### Integration

NeuVector provides a number of ways to integrate, including a REST API, CLI, SYSLOG, RBACs, SAML, LDAP, and webhooks. See the Automation section for examples of scripting using the REST API.

Integrations with other ecosystem partners such as Sonatype (Nexus Lifecycle), IBM Cloud (QRadar and Security Advisor), Prometheus/Grafana, are also supported. Many of these can be found on the [NeuVector Github](https://github.com/neuvector) page.

The following configurations can be found in Settings:

#### OpenShift/Kubernetes RBACs

Select this option if you are using Red Hat OpenShift Role Based Access Controls (RBACs) and would like NeuVector to automatically read and enforce those. If selected, OpenShift users can log into the NeuVector console using their OpenShift credentials, and will only have access to the resources (Projects, containers, nodes etc) according to their role in the OpenShift cluster. OpenShift integration uses the OAuth2 protocol.

:::warning important
Do not use the setting in OpenShift AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider which allows any password to be used to log in. This will allow a user to login into NeuVector with any password as well (as a read only user). It will also create a new user in OpenShift for every login (see ‘oc get user’ results).
:::

:::note
The default Admin user of NeuVector and any additional users created in NeuVector will still be active with OpenShift RBACs enabled.

#### Trust External Root CAs with Helm

NeuVector can be configured to trust external root Certificate Authorities (CAs) for secure connections such as LDAPS, OIDC, and registry scanning. This configuration enables trusted communication with external authentication and image registry systems.

When configured through the NeuVector Manager UI, the root CA information is stored directly in the Consul database. No Kubernetes Secret or ConfigMap object is created automatically. As a result, this setting cannot be managed through Helm by default because Helm relies on Kubernetes objects for configuration management.

To configure trusted root CAs, use a custom ConfigMap that provides the CA certificates and enables TLS verification.

Create an override.yaml file that includes your CA certificate and TLS verification settings:
```yaml
controller:
  configmap:
    enabled: true
    data:
      sysinitcfg.yaml: |
        cacerts:
        - -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          MIID0zCCArugAwIBAgIU...
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        enable_tls_verification: true

```

Save this configuration as override.yaml, then deploy NeuVector using Helm.

```bash
helm install neuvector neuvector/core -n neuvector --set manager.svc.type=NodePort,imagePullSecrets=regsecret -f override.yaml
```

After deployment, confirm that the configuration is applied by viewing the neuvector-init ConfigMap:

```bash
kubectl get cm neuvector-init -o yaml
```

You should see the certificate block and TLS verification settings reflected in the output.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  sysinitcfg.yaml: |
    cacerts:
    - -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIID0zCCArugAwIBAgIU...      
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    enable_tls_verification: true
kind: ConfigMap

```
:::note

After Helm installation, verify that NeuVector is running and accessible:
```bash
NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get -n neuvector -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" svc neuvector-service-webui)
NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath="{.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}")
echo https://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT
```
Open this URl in a browser to access NeuVector Manager UI

##### Kubernetes RBACs

To manually configure RBACs for Kubernetes namespaces, open the Advanced Setting in the new user creation screen in Settings -> Users -> Add User. Here you can enter the namespaces(s) which this user should have access to in NeuVector.

#### SYSLOG

Enter the SYSLOG server IP and select the level of notification. You can also use a DNS name and/or select TCP for configuration.

#### Webhooks

Notifications can be sent via webhooks to an endpoint. Enter the endpoint URL for notifications to be sent. Webhook notifications for custom events can be configured in Policy -> Response Rules

#### Directory/SSO Integration

See the next sections for LDAP, MSAD, SAML, OpenId and other integrations. See the [Basics -> Users & Roles](/configuration/users#users) section for predefined and custom roles in NeuVector which can be mapped in the integration.
