### Monitor Overview of Security Status

In the UI Extension in the Rancher portal, NeuVector's Dashboard works similar as its standalone page. It provides security risk score factors to let users know the security status of their clusters. In the bottom panel, it provides 4 tabs to let users switch the charts to monitor different categories.

In the Security Events tab, the line chart shows a date-based event count in a timeline.
The top security events bar charts presents the top 5 source and destination endpoints.
