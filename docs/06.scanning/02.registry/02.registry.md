title: Registry Scanning Configuration
taxonomy:
    category: docs
slug: /scanning/registry
---

Registry scanning requires that the NeuVector Allinone or Controller container be deployed on a host/node. Please see the [Installation/Deployment](/basics/installation) section for how to deploy the NeuVector containers. Configure registry scanning from the NeuVector console after logging in to the manager.

In addition, make sure there is a NeuVector scanner container deployed and configured to connect to the Allinone or Controller. In 4.0 and later, the neuvector/scanner container must be deployed separate from the allinone or controller.

:::note
Registry image scanning is performed by the scanner and the image is pulled and expanded in memory. If expanded image sizes larger than 500MB are expected, consider increasing the scanner memory to 1.5GB or more to provide capacity and headroom for the scanner.
:::

To increase registry scanning performance and scalability, multiple scanner pods can be deployed on different nodes to distribute the scanning tasks across multiple scanners. See the section [Multiple Parallel Scanners](/scanning/scanners) for details.

For multi-cluster (federated) environments, the primary (master) cluster can scan a registry/repo designated as a federated registry. The scan results from these registries will be synchronized to all managed (remote) clusters. This enables display of scan results in the managed cluster console as well as use of the results in admission control rules of the managed cluster. Registries only need to be scanned once instead of by each cluster, reducing CPU/memory and network bandwidth usage. See the [multi-cluster](/navigation/multicluster/) section for more details.

### Configure Registry Scanning

To configure registries and repositories to be scanning, go to the Assets -> Registries menu in the NeuVector console. Add or edit registries to be scanned. Use the Filter to define repositories or subsets of images to be scanned. If your registry requires access through a proxy, this can be configured in Settings -> Configuration.

![Registry](registry-scan.png)

The registry will be scanned according to a schedule, which is configurable. By default, only new or updated images will be scanned. If you want to re-scan all applicable images whenever the CVE database is updated, select the Rescan After CVE DB Update button when configuring the registry. You can also select Layered Scan to show vulnerabilities by each layer in the image (note: layered scans can take longer and consume more resources to complete).

After the scan is completed you will see the results below it. Click on the repository/tag to see vulnerabilities and click on the vulnerability to see more info. You can also download the report in a CSV file or see the results in the Event logs.

From v5.4.0 NeuVector provides a "View all scanned images" option. Users don't have to look into a registry to see a specific image. Instead, users can click the last row to list all scanned images.

![Registry](view-all-scanned-images.png)

Users can also land on the Registries page and open specific images from the hyperlink from the Containers page. If the image name is not clickable, it means that the image has not been scanned yet.

![Container](link-to-image-scan-result.png)

![Layered](image_scan_4.png)

The scan results include vulnerabilities by image layer, if this option was selected during registry/repository configuration, as well the compliance checks results. Click the compliance tab when viewing the scan results for the image to see compliance checks.

Scanning will also discover and list all Modules (ie, an inventory) in the image, as shown below. It will also summarize the vulnerability risk by module and list all vulnerabilities for each module.

![Modules](Image_Modules.png)

Scanning is supported for images on public and private docker registries that are based on Native Docker, Amazon ECR, Redhat/Openshift, jFrog, Microsoft ACR, Sonatype Nexus, Harbor, Google cloud and other registries.  The scan report for the image comprises of the vulnerability status of various packages and binaries in the image. The brief summary of the scan report can be sent via webhook using the Response rule configuration in Policy -> Response Rules, or by Syslog by configuring a syslog server in Settings -> Configuration. Results can also be viewed in the Event logs.

At least one repository filter is required (can't be left blank).

#### Repository filter examples

![filters](1-filter-examples.png)

Notes:

1. To scan all image tags, add filter as &#42; or &#42;:&#42;. This works on all registry types except the public docker registry.
2. Repository should be full name if organization is nil for public docker registry or add library before repository as given above.
3. Create a virtual repository and add all local repository to it to scan all tags on a JFrog registry with the subdomain docker access method.
4. Regular expressions can be used in a filter. For example alpine:3.[8|9].* will scan all 3.8.x and 3.9.x images and tags on docker hub.

#### Registry scan options

+ Scan Layers:
    - Provides vulnerability scan result for every image layer separately
    - Provides information about commands executed, packages added in the layer
    - Images size of each layer 
+ Auto Scan:
    - Auto Scan is only supported with OpenShift imagestream integration. Proper role binding should be configured in advance.
    - When Auto Scan is enabled, as soon as an image is pushed to the registry, the image scan will be scheduled.
+ Periodical Scan:
    - Enable periodic scan to scan periodically
    - Scan interval can set to be between 5 minutes to every 7 days.
    - Because many Admission Control checks rely on image scan result, enabling periodical scan helps make sure Admission Control has the up-to-date information of the images.
    - Note that NeuVector will scan images in a regsistry that are new/changed from the previous scan.
+ Rescan after CVE DB update
    - Enable this option to rescan all images after the vulnerability database is updated.

#### Configuring Proxy server for Registry 

Please go to Settings -> Configuration to configure proxy settings for registry scanning.

##### Stability issues in Openshift 3.7 Registry

In OpenShift 3.7, API calls to pull container image metadata or to download an image can fail randomly. It can also fail on random images in different scan runs. You may see incomplete image lists or scans may fail on some images when this happens. If this occurs, the repository can be rescanned.

  --volume /srv/gitlab/data:/var/opt/gitlab \
gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest
External_URL:  http://10.1.7.73:9096
Registry_URL: https://10.1.7.73:9095
```

##### Obtain Gitlab private token as shown below

+ Navigate to the settings page from the icon located at the upper-righthand corner of the GitLab login page as illustrated below:

![gitlab](gitlabsettings.png)

+ Navigate to the Access_Tokens page as shown below from the User_Settings page: 

![gitlab](gitlabusersettings.png)

+ Fill in all applicable fields, and click “Create personal access token” when ready to generate the access token:

![gitlab](gitlabpersonaltoken_new.png)

+ Access token will no longer be available once the user has navigated away from the generated token page.  Therefore, it is highly recommended to make a copy of the access token prior to navigating or closing the following page:

![gitlab](gitlabaccesstoken.png)

##### Obtaining External and Registry URLs

External-URL:   The external url is the API-Server's URL.  
Registry-URL:  This can be obtained from the Container Registry page of the GitLab webconsole.  One way to get to this page is navigating from the GitLab’s webconsole from Projects > Your Projects > Administrator / … > Left-Pane (Container Registry) > Mouse-over (root/.../)
 
The following is a sample screen-capture of the page that reveals both the External-URL and the Registry-URL:

![gitlab](gitlabexternalurl.png)

##### Add Gitlab Registry from the NeuVector Console

+ Choose Gitlab as the registry type
+ Give unique name to the registry
+ Type registry URL with port
+ Provide username and password if required by the registry
+ Provide Gitlab external URL and the private token obtained from the last section

![gitlab](gitlabregistryscan.png)

:::note
The Registry URL is used for pulling images into the NeuVector scanner-platform from GitLab to do registry scanning.  While the External URL is used for retrieving a list of images, registries, and metadata used by the registry scanning feature.
