#### Mapping Groups to Roles and Namespaces
Please see the [Users and Roles](/configuration/users#mapping-groups-to-roles-and-namespaces) section for how to map groups to preset and custom roles as well as namespaces in NeuVector.

 
###Troubleshooting
1.ADFS SamlResponseSignature needs to be either MessageOnly or MessageAndAssertion.  Use Get-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust command to verify or update it.
