### Replacing the Self-Signed Certificate with PKCS Certificate
The built-in self-signed certificate can be replaced by a supported PKCS certificate. These should be replaced in both the Manager and Controller deployments.

The NeuVector web console supports 2 different self-signed certificate types, specifically, the PKCS8 (Private-Key Information Syntax Standard) and PKCS1 (RSA Cryptography Standard).  The self-signed certificate can be replaced with either of these PKCS types.  

The steps to generate the secret that will be consumed by NeuVectorâ€™s web console originating from the key and certificate using either of the PKCS methods will be illustrated below.  The important note here is, with the use of the wildcard for the DNS as being part of the alternate-subject-name parameter during the key and certificate creation, this enables the name of your choosing to be mapped to the Management console IP-Address without restricting to a particular CN.

#### Generate and Use a PKCS8 Self-signed Certificate
1. Create a PKCS8 key and certificate
```
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 730 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -config ca.cfg -extensions 'v3_req'
Sample ca.cfg
[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no
[req_distinguished_name]
C = US
ST = California
L = San Jose
O = NeuVector Inc.
OU = Neuvector
CN = Neuvector
[v3_req]
keyUsage = keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = *
```
2. Create the secret from the generated key and certificate files from above
```
kubectl create secret tls https-cert -n neuvector --key=tls.key --cert=tls.crt
```
3. Edit the yaml direclty for the manager and controller deployments to add the mounts
```
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /etc/neuvector/certs/ssl-cert.key
          name: cert
          readOnly: true
          subPath: tls.key
        - mountPath: /etc/neuvector/certs/ssl-cert.pem
          name: cert
          readOnly: true
          subPath: tls.crt
      volumes:
      - name: cert
        secret:
          defaultMode: 420
          secretName: https-cert
```
Or update with the helm chart with similar values.yaml
```
manager:
  certificate:
    secret: https-cert
    keyFile: tls.key
    pemFile: tls.crt
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    host:  %CHANGE_HOST_NAME%
    ingressClassName: ""
    path: "/"  # or this could be "/api", but might need "rewrite-target" annotation
    annotations:
      ingress.kubernetes.io/protocol: https
      # ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    tls: true
    secretName: https-cert

controller:
  certificate:
    secret: https-cert
    keyFile: tls.key
    pemFile: tls.crt
```
Then update with `helm upgrade -i neuvector ...`. For reference here are all the values https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core.
