### Troubleshooting NeuVector Deployments

The NeuVector containers are deployed, managed, and updated using the same orchestration tool used for application workloads. Please be sure to review the online documentation for each step necessary during deployment. Often deployments are attempted by just copying the sample yaml files and deploying them without reviewing the steps prior, such as properly configuring registries, secrets, or RBACs/rolebindings.

#### Initial Deployment

+ Check that the NeuVector containers can be pulled with correct authentication. Check the secret used and make sure the cluster is able to access the appropriate registry.
+ Make sure the changes to the yaml required (e.g. NodePort or LoadBalancer) or Helm values settings are set appropriately.
+ Check the platform and container run-time and make changes as needed (e.g. PKS, containerd, CRI-O).

#### Login and Initial Configuration

+ Check to make sure appropriate access to the manager (IP address, port, route) is allowed through firewalls.

#### Ongoing Operation

+ Directory integration. NeuVector supports specific configurations for LDAP/AD and other integrations for groups and roles. Contact NeuVector for additional troubleshooting steps and a tool for AD troubleshooting.
+ Registry scanning. Most issues are related to registry authentication errors or inability for the controller to access the registry from the cluster.
+ For performance issues, make sure the scanner is allocated enough memory for scanning large images. Also, CPU and memory minimums can be specified in the pod policy to ensure adequate performance at scale.
+ Admission Control. See the Troubleshooting section in the section Security Risks... -> Admission Controls.

#### Updating

+ Use rolling updates for the controller. If you are rebooting hosts, make sure to monitor the controllers as they move to other hosts, or redeploy on the rebooted hosts, to make sure they are able to start, join the controller cluster, and stabilize/sync. Rebooting all hosts at once or too quickly can result in unknown states for the controllers.
+ Use a persistent volume claim to store the NeuVector configuration for the case that all controllers/nodes go down in the cluster.
+ When updating to a new version, review the online documentation to identify changes/additions to the yaml required, as well as other changes such as rolebindings or new services (e.g. admission control webhook, persistent volume claim etc).

### Debug Logs
To view the logs of a NeuVector container, for example a controller pod

```shell
kubectl logs neuvector-controller-pod-777fdc5668-4jkjn -n neuvector
```

These logs may show cluster connectivity issues, admin actions, scanning activity and other useful entries. If there are multiple controllers running it may be necessary to inspect each one. These logs can be piped to a file to send to NeuVector support.

#### Turning on Debug mode for NeuVector Controllers

For issues that require in-depth investigation, debug mode can be enabled for the controllers/allinones, which will log detailed information. This can increase the log file size by a large amount, so it is recommended to turn it off after collecting them.

#### Kubernetes, OpenShift and Other Orchestration Logs

It can be helpful to inspect the logs from orchestration tools to see all deployment activity including pod creation timestamps and status, deployments, daemonsets and other management actions of the NeuVector containers performed by the orchestration tool. 

```shell
kubectl get events -n neuvector
```

### Support Log

The support log contains additional information which is useful for NeuVector Support, including system configuration, containers, policies, notifications, and NeuVector container details.

To download the support log, go to Settings -> Configuration and select Collect Log.

### Set Logging Severity Levels

The enforcer and controller support four log levels that can be set: error, warn, info, debug. The log level can be set via Helm chart or deployment YAML during installation, or they can be set during runtime via the command-line. After the log level is set, only specific logs are displayed in the enforcer or controller log.

#### Setting Options

+ To set the log level via Helm chart or deployment YAML during installation time:

  Reuse the variable `CTRL_PATH_DEBUG` for both the enforcer and controller general log to set the log level value(error, warn, info, debug).

  + If the value is "error": The log level is set to "ERRO"; only "ERRO" log is displayed, and "WARN", "INFO", and "DEBU" logs will not be displayed.
  + If the value is "warn": The log level is set to "WARN"; only "WARN" and "ERRO" logs are displayed, and "INFO", and "DEBU" logs will not be displayed.
  + If the value is "info": The log level is set to "INFO"; only "INFO", "WARN", and "ERRO" logs are displayed, and "DEBU" log will not be displayed.
  + If the value is empty (if the command-line only has the option without the value), or if the input is "1", "e", "y", "Y", "t", "T", or if the input is "debug": The log level is set to "DEBU", and "DEBU", "INFO", "WARN", and "ERRO" logs are displayed.
  + If the value is anything else: The log level is set to "INFO"; only "INFO", "WARN", and "ERRO" logs are displayed, and the "DEBU" log will not be displayed.
+ To set the log level using the command-line during runtime:

    Set the log level for specific enforcer or controller:
    Command:

    ```shell
    set {enforcer|controller} {ID_OR_NAME} log_level {error|warn|info|debug}
    ```

    Example:

    ```shell
    admin#127.0.0.1> set enforcer 470465277a36 log_level debug
    admin#127.0.0.1> show enforcer setting 470465277a36
    +-----------+-------+
    | Field     | Value |
    +-----------+-------+
    | log_level | debug |
    | debug     | cpath |
    +-----------+-------+
    ( default debug level setting will only set the cpath category)
    ```

    Set the system log level for all enforcers or controllers:

    Command:

    ```shell
    set system log_level {enforcers|controllers} {error|warn|info|debug}
    ```

    Example:

    ```shell
    admin#127.0.0.1> set system log_level enforcers error
    admin#127.0.0.1> show enforcer setting 470465277a36
    +-----------+-------+
    | Field     | Value |
    +-----------+-------+
    | log_level | error |
    | debug     |       |
    +-----------+-------+
    (if the log level is "debug", the log display will be dependent on the category)
    ```

#### Example

Set the `CTRL_PATH_DEBUG` to “debug” in the enforcer YAML and then deploy the enforcer:

```YAML
containers:
- env:
  - name: ENF_MONITOR_TRACE
    value: "1"
  - name: CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR
    value: neuvector-svc-controller.neuvector
  - name: CLUSTER_ADVERTISED_ADDR
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        apiVersion: v1
        fieldPath: status.podIP
  - name: CTRL_PATH_DEBUG
    value: "debug"
```

The below logs can be displayed in the enforcer log with an example command:

```shell
k logs -f {ENFORCER_ID} -n neuvector | grep "|DEBU|AGT| \ | |INFO|AGT| \ | |WARN|AGT|\|ERRO|AGT|"
```

+ |ERRO|AGT|
+ |WARN|AGT|
+ |INFO|AGT|
+ |DEBU|AGT|

### Using the CLI to turn on Debug Mode

Login to NeuVector manager pod with user and password (recommended in a separate terminal window).

```shell
kubectl exec -it neuvector-manager-pod-5bb76b6754-rlmnp -n neuvector -- cli 
```

```shell
#neuvector-svc-controller.neuvector> login
```

Get the list of controllers. Find the controller with the Leader = True.

```shell
show controller
```

Turn on the debug mode in the leader controller using the ID or name of controller

```shell
set controller 4fce427cf963 debug -c all
```

To turn on debug mode on all controllers

```shell
set system controller_debug -c all
```

Perform the activity in NeuVector which you wish to debug. Then view the controller logs (in a separate terminal window).

```shell
kubectl logs <leader_controller_pod_name> -n neuvector
```

If required, capture the logs and send them to NeuVector.

Turn off Debug mode on the controller (back in the CLI window).

```shell
set controller 4fce427cf963 debug
exit
```

Check controller debug status.

```shell
show controller setting 289d67396fcb
```

### Using the REST API to turn on Debug Mode

Set access token with your IP, user, password:

```shell
_controllerIP_="<your_controller_ip>"
_controllerRESTAPIPort_="10443"
_neuvectorUsername_="admin"
_neuvectorPassword_="admin"
```

:::note
For Kubernetes based deployments you can get the Controller IP in the following command output:
:::

```shell
kubectl get pod -n neuvector -o wide | grep controller
```

:::note
If accessing the REST API from outside the cluster, see the Automation section instructions.
:::

Get the authentication token

```shell
curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"password": {"username": "'$_neuvectorUsername_'", "password": "'$_neuvectorPassword_'"}}' "https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/auth" > /dev/null 2>&1 > token.json
_TOKEN_=`cat token.json | jq -r '.token.token'`
```

:::note
You may need to install jq ($sudo yum install jq)
:::

Enable Debug Mode

```shell
curl -X PATCH -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_" -d '{"config": {"controller_debug": ["cpath", "conn"]}}' "https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/system/config"  > /dev/null 2>&1   > set_debug.json
#debug options - cpath, conn, mutex, scan, cluster , all
```

Disable Debug on all controllers in a cluster

```shell
curl -X PATCH -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_" -d '{"config": {"controller_debug": []}}' "https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/system/config"  > /dev/null 2>&1   > set_debug.json
```

Check the controller debug status in a cluster

```bash
curl  -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_"  "https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/system/config"  > /dev/null 2>&1   > system_setting.json

cat system_setting.json | jq .config.controller_debug
```

Logout 

```shell
echo `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` log out
curl -k -X 'DELETE' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $_TOKEN_" "https://$_controllerIP_:$_controllerRESTAPIPort_/v1/auth" > /dev/null 2>&1
```
