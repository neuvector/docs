## Event Reporting

### Security Events

In the UI Extension on the Rancher portal, the **Security Events** tab works similarly to the NeuVector standalone page. The events can be triggered by several factors:

- Dangerous conversation or data transportation from somewhere to the endpoint (Node or pod).
- End-to-end violated connection against network policy.
- Violated operation against process profile rule.
- Violated operation against file access rule.

Slide the dot left or right on the time slider to filter events by date.

Type in keywords into the quick filter box to filter any event which includes the keyword.

Open the **Advanced Filter** side panel, and you will find multiple options supporting your search:

- Severity, Location and Category can be filtered according to the tags on the right side of the event title.
- The autocomplete list supports user entries for Host, Source, and Destination fields and supports a multiple tag-input box for Namespace.
